# Installation Guide

These steps are based on an Ubuntu environment but should work similarly on other systems that support Docker.

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository

Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### Export Environment Variables

A `.env` file with all environment variables is necessary to run the application. Once placing the `.env` file in the main directory, run the following command:

```bash
source .env
```

### Start the services with Docker

Run the following command to initialize the entire system, including the user interface and backend:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Access the User Interface

Once the services are running, the React UI will be available at http://localhost:3000

# Architecture

This architecture diagram provides a high-level view of how the different components in the system interact with each other. Each part of the architecture will be explained in more detail in the following sections:
* **React User Interface**: The front-end of the application is built with React, it serves as the user interface and sends requests to the Flask API
* **Flask API**: The Flask API acts as the backend, handling requests from the React UI, it processes the data, interacts with the database, and returns the sentiment of the requested company
* **MySQL Database**: All data is stored and managed in a MySQL database, the database is updated regularly by scrapers
* **Scrapers**: The scrapers gather News, Reddit and Yahoo data for sentiment analysis relevant to specific stock tickers or companies, which are then stored in the database
* **Sentiment Analyzer**: The Sentiment Analyzer processes the gathered data and user input, analyzing the text to determine the sentiment score, which reflects the overall tone of the input.

# Scraping APIs

## Reddit

The Python Reddit API utilizes [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to scrape posts and comments from various subreddits. The scraping process targets posts and comments related to specific stock tickers (e.g., NVDA). By searching for mentions of the stock ticker within the post titles or content, only comments relevant to that stock are selected for sentiment analysis. This ensures that the analysis focuses on discussions directly associated with the target stock.

## News

The News Scraping API is constructed using data from two external APIs: [News Data](https://newsdata.io/) and [News API](https://newsapi.org/) which are combined to create our own API.

Key features include:
* Ensuring no duplicate news articles are stored
* Only news articles relevant to specific stock tickers or company names (present in the title or content) are scraped and added to the database
* The news is scraped daily, ensuring fresh and up-to-date content

This process provides a consistent, daily stream of unique, company-specific news updates for further processing or display.

## Yahoo Finance

The Yahoo Finance scraper targets the Conversation section of stock-specific pages, where users actively discuss and share market sentiments. The section is particularly valuable for sentiment analysis as users can explicitly mark their stance as "Bullish" or "Bearish" alongside their comments. This feature provides additional context to enhance our sentiment analysis accuracy. While the scraping process is currently performed daily, full automation remains a work in progress due to Yahoo Finance's sophisticated bot detection system. Manual intervention is required until a solution to bypass these restrictions is developed.

## Twitter/X

Not Implemented.

# Sentiment Analyzer

The Sentiment Analyzer used for this project was made by [vaderSentiment](https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/) and modified to fit the narratives of this project. A lot of changes were made to the `vader_lexicon.txt` file to be more tailored to stock market and finance terminology, a list of those changes can be seen in the [lexicon.txt](./docs/lexicon.txt) file. The tool evaluates emotions and generates score from -1 to 1. It specializes in analyzins social media content by understanding slang, emojis and informal language. The tool provides a compound score that indicates if a text is positive, negative or neutral, making it particularly useful in the case of our projet.

# Database

The Data Base Management System (DBMS) used in this project is MySQL. The database is divided in folders, one for each stock. Each folder contains multiple tables, one for each source (i.e Reddit, News, Yahoo Finance, Twitter/X). Taking the example of NVDA:

```
NVDA tables:
  - Reddit
  - News
  - Yahoo Finance
  - Twitter/X
  - ...
```

## Reddit

The Reddit section of the database stores both posts and comments scraped from relevant subreddits. 

### Data Structure

The data is structured in the following way:

* **subreddit**: The name of the subreddit where the post or comment originated
* **post_id**: A unique identifier for the post
* **comment_id**: If the record is a comment, this column contains the unique comment ID, posts have `NULL` in this field
* **date**: The date the post or comment was created
* **score**: The score (i.e., upvotes) of the post or comment on Reddit
* **sentiment**: A sentiment score on a scale from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive) calculated by the Sentiment Analyzer
* **description**: The text of the post or comment

**Reddit Database (NVDA)**

|subreddit  |post_id|comment_id|date       |score|sentiment|description|
|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|-----|---------|-----------|
|stocks     |180s2lt|`NULL`    |2023-11-21 |726  |0.4588   |Nvidia crush earnings yet again|
|stocks     |1b9l1ex|ktxppxv   |2024-03-08 |1    |-0.128   |literally sold NVDA yesterday from fear of a drop. wow|
|stocks     |1b9l1ex|ktxtmyh   |2024-03-08 |3    |0.5848   |Nvda dip is rare. Buy while you can!|
|NVDA_Stock |1bcbw8h|`NULL`    |2024-03-11 |21   |0.2263   |Someone bought $780 MILLION worth of NVDA call options of Friday|

This structure helps ensure accurate tracking of both posts and their related comments, with each comment tied back to a specific post via its `post_id`. Posts themselves will always have a `NULL` value in the `comment_id` column to distinguish them from comments.

### Score Calculation

The score is the number of upvotes (or downvotes) a post or comment has received. This acts as a multiplier in determining the weight of a post's or comment's sentiment in the overall calculation. Higher-scoring posts/comments will have a larger influence on the stock's sentiment.

### Sentiment Calculation

This is a grade between -1 and 1 that represents the tone of the post or comment received by the Sentiment Analyzer. A score of -1 indicates highly negative sentiment, while 1 represents highly positive sentiment.

## News

The News section of the database stores articles scraped from external sources. 

### Data Structure

The data is structured in the following columns:
* **author**: The name of the article's author
* **content**: The main body or the article
* **date**: The date the article was published
* **sentiment**: A calculated score based on the sentiment of the article
* **title**: The headline or title of the article
* **url**: The link of the original article
* **weight**: A value representing the article's relevance and importance

### Sentiment Calculation

The sentiment score is calculated by analyzing both the title and content of the article. To minimize misinterpretation from longer content that might include irrelevant details, the sentiment is weighted:
* **80%** of the sentiment is derived from the title
* **20%** comes from the content

### Weight Calculation

The weight score represents the importance of an article, starting with a default value of 1. This value is adjusted using the following multipliers:
* **Stock in title**: If the stock ticker or company name appears in the title, the article's weight is multiplied by **10x**
* **Website's reputation**: Articles from more reputable websites receive a multiplier ranging from **2x to 10x** based on their credibility
* **Author's reputation**: Articles written by reputable authors are multiplied by **2x**
* **Author not provided**: If the author's name is provided, the article's weight is multiplied by **2x**
* **Content not empty**: Articles with non-empty content are multiplied by **2x**

This weighting system helps prioritize more relevant and higher-quality articles in the database, ensuring accurate data for further analysis

## Yahoo Finance

The Yahoo Finance section stores user comments from the Conversation section of stock-specific pages.

### Data Structure

The data is structured in the following columns:
* **author**: The username of the comment author
* **content**: The text content of the comment
* **date**: The date the comment was posted
* **sentiment**: A calculated score based on the comment's sentiment
* **weight**: The difference between likes and dislikes on the comment

**Yahoo Database (NVDA)**
|author  |content|date|sentiment       |weight|

|JeffG |Investors focused on backward-looking metrics likely missed out on Nvidia (NVDA), one of the most lucrative investment opportunities in the past decade.|2024-05-24  |0.5046 |20   |

### Sentiment Calculation

The sentiment score combines multiple factors to generate a comprehensive evaluation: 
* **Comment Content**: The primary sentiment is derived from analyzing the text using the sentiment analyzer
* **User's Position**: If the user explicitly marks their stance as "Bullish" or "Bearish," this influences the final score
* **Community Response**: The ratio of likes to dislikes affects the sentiment weighting:
  * Comments with negative sentiment but many dislikes are interpreted as bullish indicators
  * Comments with positive sentiment but many dislikes are interpreted as bearish indicators

The final sentiment impact is calculated by multiplying the sentiment score by the weight:
* Negative sentiment √ó Negative weight = Positive impact
* Negative sentiment √ó Positive weight = Negative impact
* Positive sentiment √ó Negative weight = Negative impact
* Positive sentiment √ó Positive weight = Positive impact

For example: 
* A bearish comment (-0.8 sentiment) with -20 weight would result in a +16 positive impact
* A bullish comment (0.9 sentiment) with +30 weight would result in a +27 positive impact
* Comments with weights close to zero have minimal impact on the final sentiment calculation

This multiplication approach ensures that community disagreement with negative comments (through dislikes) properly translates into positive market sentiment, and vice versa. Notably, Yahoo Finance conversations tend to be heavily one-sided for each stock, with users typically being either overwhelmingly bullish or bearish, making it an excellent indicator of retail investor sentiment.

# Quality Assurance

Our system ensures high reliability and performance through automated testing and containerization. Below are the two key components of our QA strategy:

## Github Actions

GitHub Actions uses workflows to automatically run Unit Tests on various parts of the system. These tests ensure that all components are functioning correctly and are regularly updated. The following parts are tested periodically:
* Database (every 6 hours)
* News Scraper (daily)
* Reddit Scraper (every 6 hours)
* Sentiment analyzer (every 6 hours)

This automated process ensures that our core components maintain data integrity and provide accurate results.

## Docker

The User Interface, API and MySQL Database run in different Docker container, ensuring consistent and reproducible environments across different systems. As we continue to improve our scrapers, they will be added to the containerized environment once they reach a stable and production-ready state.

## Locust

Coming soon.

## Selenium

Coming soon.

# Troubleshooting

## Issues with local deployment

If the installation guide did not resolve the issue, you may need to obtain specific credentials and set environment variables. These credentials are required for scraping Reddit, accessing two different news APIs, and connecting to the database. Please contact Hugo Par√© (hpare040@uottawa.ca) for the credentials.

Once you have the credentials, export the necessary environment variables like so:

```bash
export <VARIABLE_NAME>=<VALUE>
```

## Issues with Docker services

If running docker compose up -d fails, you can troubleshoot by inspecting the status of the Docker containers. Use the following command to check:
```bash
docker ps
```

You should see output similar to this:
```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                    NAMES
84ed9f55ce95   python:3.9     "sh -c 'pip install ‚Ä¶"   6 seconds ago   Up 5 seconds   0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp, :::5000->5000/tcp                api
f4c5629d9bf9   node:14        "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   6 seconds ago   Up 5 seconds   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp, :::3000->3000/tcp                react-ui
da82b19e4966   mysql:latest   "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   6 seconds ago   Up 5 seconds   33060/tcp, 0.0.0.0:3307->3306/tcp, [::]:3307->3306/tcp   mysql-db
```

If a container is not running as expected, you can check its logs using:
```bash
docker logs <container_name>
```

## Issues with MySQL

If you encounter issues with MySQL, you will need to verify that the database is running correctly. Use the following command to check the databases:
```bash
docker exec mysql-db mysql -h mysql -u root -p<password> -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
```

If `MarketSentiment` is listed, you can check the tables in the database:
```bash
docker exec mysql-db mysql -h mysql -u root -p<password> -D MarketSentiment -e "SHOW TABLES;"
```

If the tables are present but not populated correctly, you can check the row count for a specific table:
```bash
docker exec mysql-db mysql -h mysql -u root -p<password> -D MarketSentiment -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM REDDIT_NVDA_DATA;"
```

If the result is `0`, the issue might be with the database initialization. Refer to the `initializeDatabase.sh` script for more details on fixing this.
