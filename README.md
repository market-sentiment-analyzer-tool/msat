# Market Sentiment Analyzer Tool

Introducing our innovative project, a **Stock Market Sentiment Analyzer Tool**, developed by **Hugo ParÃ© (#300173735)** and **Jayden Bergevin (#300173747)** for our Capstone project in the **SEG4910-4911 class**. The mission of the **"Sheep Indicator"** is to offer valuable insight to investors aiming to decode the market sentiments efficiently.

# Architecture

This architecture diagram provides a high-level view of how the different components in the system interact with each other. Each part of the architecture will be explained in more detail in the following sections:
* React User Interface: The front-end of the application is built with React, it serves as the user interface and sends requests to the Flask API
* Flask API: The Flask API acts as the backend, handling requests from the React UI, it processes the data, interacts with the database, and returns the sentiment of the requested company
* MySQL Database: All data is stored and managed in a MySQL database, the database is updated regularly by scrapers
* News Scraper and Reddit Scraper: These scrapers gather news and Reddit data for sentiment analysis relevant to specific stock tickers or companies, which are then stored in the database

# Scraping APIs

## Reddit

The Python Reddit API used in this project was made by [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). It was used to scrape posts and comments from different subreddits. Posts and comments from a specific stock (example: NVDA) were scraped following this technique:

```
if a post mentions NVDA:
-> include the post
-> include all the comments associated with the post

otherwise:
-> include only comments mentioning NVDA
```

This way, only comments that are related to NVDA are taken into consideration for the sentiment analysis.

## News

The News Scraping API is constructed using data from two external APIs: [News Data](https://newsdata.io/) and [News API](https://newsapi.org/) which are combined to create our own API.

Key features include:
* Ensuring no duplicate news articles are stored
* Only news articles relevant to specific stock tickers or company names (present in the title or content) are scraped and added to the database
* The news is scraped daily, ensuring fresh and up-to-date content

This process provides a consistent, daily stream of uniuqe, company-specific news updates for further processing or display.

## Yahoo Finance

Not Implemented.

## Twitter/X

Not Implemented.

# Sentiment Analyzer

The Sentiment Analyzer used for this project was made by [vaderSentiment](https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/) and modified to fit the narratives of this project. A lot of changes were made to the `vader_lexicon.txt` file to be more tailored to stock market and finance terminology, a list of those changes can be seen in the [lexicon.txt file](lexicon.txt).

# Database

The Data Base Management System (DBMS) used in this project is MySQL. The database is divided in folders, one for each stock. Each folder contains multiple tables, one for each source (i.e Reddit, News, Yahoo Finance, Twitter/X). Taking the example of NVDA:

```
NVDA tables:
  - Reddit
  - News
  - Yahoo Finance
  - Twitter/X
  - ...
```

## Reddit

For the case of Reddit, the posts and comments scraped are stored this way:

|subreddit  |post_id|comment_id|date       |score|sentiment|description|
|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|-----|---------|-----------|
|stocks     |180s2lt|`NULL`    |2023-11-21 |726  |0.4588   |Nvidia crush earnings yet again|
|stocks     |1b9l1ex|ktxppxv   |2024-03-08 |1    |-0.128   |literally sold NVDA yesterday from fear of a drop. wow|
|stocks     |1b9l1ex|ktxtmyh   |2024-03-08 |3    |0.5848   |Nvda dip is rare. Buy while you can!|
|NVDA_Stock |1bcbw8h|`NULL`    |2024-03-11 |21   |0.2263   |Someone bought $780 MILLION worth of NVDA call options of Friday|

The database stores both posts and comments, each comment is associated to a post. All posts have `NULL` as their `comment_id` value. Two columns are important to calculate the sentiment of the stock, explanations are listed below:

```
score: note associated with a comment or post, the higher the score the higher the weight on the overall sentiment (i.e upvotes on Reddit)
sentiment: grade on a scale of -1 to 1 (-1 being very negative and 1 being very positive) given to a comment or post by the Sentiment Analyzer
```

## News

# User Interface

Coming Soon.

# Deployment

This deployment diagram illustrates the following key components:
* User Interface (React): A user interface built with React that communicated with the backend API
* API (Flask): A Flask API that processes requests from the UI and interacts with the database
* Database (MySQL): Stores the data processed by the scrapers
* GitHub Actions: A CI/CD pipeline responsible for running unit tests on the database and scrapers and also updating the database periodically
* Docker Container: The services are encapsulated within a Docker container to ensure consistent deployment across environment
