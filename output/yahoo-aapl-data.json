All of the new models will be Apple Intelligence ready and Apple believes that will help spur upgrades and attract switchers from Android.  Fortunately, Apple can get away with selling high-end smartphones but I wonder if Android brands will be able to get consumers to pay more for A.I. features on their smartphones.  Things are looking good for the coming iPhones as Apple cornered the market on 3nm chips from TSMC and the yields are quite good.  Apple looks set for an iPhone sales recovery.  I'm jumping the gun but good luck to all longs.  Many analysts are betting on an Apple recovery with increased price targets, so I'm hopeful.",

It has surpassed all my expectations, proving to be the finest laptop I've ever owned. The battery life is incredible, the screen displays crystal-clear visuals, no noisy fans, and the overall quality is top-notch. In comparison, the $1600 HP touch screen work laptop provided during the pandemic doesn't come close in performance and the value for the money. Previously, I didn't grasp the appeal of Apple laptops as I have been a Windows guy for decades, but now I get why they're favored by many.",
