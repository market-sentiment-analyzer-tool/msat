First to market technological advantage of at least two years and perhaps 5 years or more over its competitors who are just now ramping up R&D to try and compete. Meanwhile NVIDIA is the only choice for the ubiquitous global adoption of AI by enterprises across all industries while offering turn key data center and platform options to clients via its proprietary purpose built AI platforms. I don't see any \"real\" competition from other chip makers for two years. NVIDIA is the gold standard. I think the biggest threat to NVIDIA is a macro economic black swan event that might temporarily diminish current projections of enterprise investments in NVIDIA chips and data solutions. The risk reward proposition looks very strong for the next two years and NVIDIA continues to \"beat\" on revenue and earnings while expanding the breadth and depth of its offerings.",

See the estimated earnings per share for this fiscal year (2024), see the estimated earnings per share for next fiscal year (2025), calculate forward-looking PE values for each, also calculate the expected increase in earnings per share year-over year.  Consider the market growth potential NVDA operates in, ask if NVDA has an advantage over other suppliers, and lastly has NVDA exceeded earnings estimates.  Then make an analytical decision if you want to buy or sell this stock, keeping in mind short-term fluctuations occur, but fundamentals will dictate long-term stock prices.  Ignore current PE ratio, because that is based on trailing 12 months and you want to look at future earnings. For me, NVDA is an overwhelming buy, but do your own calculations and analysis, and come to your own conclusions.",

The development of their AI chips, which they started working on years ago. The fact that these chips are tied with their own unique software platform is another example. Thir foreseeing capacity issues over a year ago and taking steps to alleviate this problem shows more foresight.... the plants under construction in Arizona, Japan, and Vietnam. So investors can restt assured that NVDA has their eye on the ball, and are looking years down the road. They really have a great vision and are doing a remarkable job of executing it.",
