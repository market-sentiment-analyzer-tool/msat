So, if there is a split this year, we should expect a post-split price between $150 & $200. Depending on the trajectory of the share price over the next few weeks, we should expect a split ratio between 5:1 and 7:1. This would require shareholder approval for more authorized shares. We shall see.",

Nvidia is trying to broaden the market beyond the data center by making their technology more accessible to end-users, like robotics companies, or healthcare providers. They are making steps towards creating their own cloud offering to end-users. They are much more than a hardware provider, but in addition to software, they will also provide the full stack.",
