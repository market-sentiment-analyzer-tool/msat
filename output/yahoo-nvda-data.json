Micron's earnings report proved that AI isn't losing ground, and spending will continue on semiconductors by the biggest players no matter what happens with the economy in the coming months (even though I still think a soft landing is what's actually going to happen). We are in the money and the stock price will reflect that very soon.",

Many bankers seem unable to grasp the full potential of the future and err on the side of caution out of fear of being wrong about this stock. I sensed the frustration in Jensen's voice on tonight's call when he was asked such basic questions, like whether AI/Blackwell will generate ROI for their customers. It was clear he was flabbergasted by the lack of understanding, even from the so-called 'big players.' Unfortunately, poor decisions by these bankers sometimes lead to unnecessary price drops.",
