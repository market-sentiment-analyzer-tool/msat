With its diverse revenue streams and its early head start in AI, I would have expected MSFT to outperform rather than to underperform.  Additionally, I think MSFT's CEO is among the best and the brightest chess players in the entire group of megacaps.  I'll stay long MSFT with the hope that the pendulum of outperformance will swing back in MSFT's direction soon.",
