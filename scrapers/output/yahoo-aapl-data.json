This company's better days are in the rear view mirror and will be there for some time.  It will be below 200 early next year. Get smart people and listen to the pros rather than that analysts who have their own agenda.  \"Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) stocks are trading lower Friday as hedge funds reduce their holdings in these companies. Amazon's hedge fund holdings fell by $11 billion in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Apple saw double the reduction in investor holdings compared to additions during the quarter.\"",
