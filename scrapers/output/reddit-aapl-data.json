For the contract, I'll agree to pay $10/share for the right to buy 1,000 shares of AAPL (so $10,000), at their current price plus 10%.

I sold enough so that the cost basis for the remaining AAPL stock = profit from my sell position. That means the remaining stock I hold in apple is 0 investment from me. So now I do not have any emotional attachment to the stock price whether is going up/down/sideways as long as EPS is decent I keep holding it."
