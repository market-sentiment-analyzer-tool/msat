The big boys saw this as an opportunity to trap them and make them scream and sweat as they then dropped it 12 points. It was coordinated with CNBC and fake news items being written. They stole the shares on the cheap and will now slowly and methodically walk it back up over the next couple months.  Just watch.",

Either Samsung or Intel would be another source.  When that agreement is penned and announced, this stock will bounce $60 points in single day.",
