AI market is too small but everyone wants a piece of the pie due to AI hype. The only company that makes money is NVDA but the share prices are valued with unrealistic expectations where they will never be able to make. NVDA growth already peak in Q1 2024 but people think their new chip will spark another round of hardward purchase frenzy all over again -- it ain't gonna happen. Companies already spent so much and are running out of money.",
