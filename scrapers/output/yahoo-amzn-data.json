They are likely to cut back spending immediately including for Christmas \ud83c\udf84 until they know their jobs are safe which is an 18 month process I hear. Does anyone working for the gov on this board agree ? This will greatly affect amazon next quarter earnings and revenues and the 80% tariffs on 95% of items sold on amazon make this stock very shaky here imo. On the aws side of the business millions of gov workers using aws in one form or another. Is this a good time to load up on amazon now do you think or lock \ud83d\udd10 in fabulous gains before the inevitable selloff ?",
