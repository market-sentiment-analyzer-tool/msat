There is a concentrated area downtown which has a number of apartment high rises and some shops. And there are some larger projects (notably Kenilworth in 20019 and Barry Frams in 20020), which although I ventured into a number of times, are....rough.\n\nIts a really complex problem. Its in part of DC called \'East of the (Anacostia) River\' or EOTR. And has historically been an impoverished black part of the city. Even in the 90s when all of DC was rough, this area was the worst of the worst. And because of the river its remained sectioned off, and even despite investments from DC, has been the slowest to proper in the thriving DC. The same reason that Amazon doesnt want to deliver there is the same reason its a food desert - crime. The most egregious corporate offender though was Walmart who agreed to put 2? stores in 20019 and 20020 back in \\~2017 if memory serves in exchange for puting stores in more affluent parts of DC. They built the stores they wanted and then reneged on the 2 others, and saw no consequences.\n\nI understand why Amazon doesn\'t feel like its safe to deliver there, but I had prime when I lived there, and it helped tremendously to offset the food/shopping desert. There needs to be stronger representation (Trayon White down in 20020 for example is a criminal who keeps getting relected), and more advocacy groups need to be vocal about the issues in this part of DC.\n\nI know this is a stock sub - this will be an immaterial lawsuite for amazon - but its a major social and political issue that many urban areas across the country face. These large companies need to be held at least somewhat accountable to provide equal services, they certainly get preferential treatment in our society, they should be helping to solve these issues not contributing to them, they certainly have the capital to do so.\n\nQuick note: I loved living in 20019 - understanding that I have a different perspective I am privileged (good income, white male) - the neighborhood was warm and welcoming, we would help each other out, and there were many genuinely kind people.
