All you have to do is put 300 in a shipment and put it in a warehouse.  \n\nThe other one is the key. Ease of access.

They couldn\'t get the concept of free shipping and price matching. They didn\'t want to be a digital store even though everybody saw the writing of brick and mortar on the wall.

AWS may only be 17% of revenue, but its margins dwarf retail, and as AI workloads scale, the demand for high-performance cloud compute is only going to accelerate. Your point about AI being â€œborn in the cloudâ€ is keyâ€”unlike historical web workloads, companies building AI models donâ€™t have the luxury of spinning up on-premise infrastructure, which locks them into providers like AWS for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Anthropic example illustrates this perfectly: startups and even larger AI companies will rely heavily on cloud providers that can offer both scale and reliability. This positions AWS not just as a commodity service, but as a **strategic backbone** for next-generation AI infrastructure. Coupled with cross-sell synergies, customer stickiness, and margin expansion through lock-in, the upside is substantial.\n\nAdditionally, the advertising business often gets overlooked. High-margin, growing, and tied to Amazonâ€™s commerce ecosystem, itâ€™s another layer of profitability that isnâ€™t captured if analysts focus solely on top-line growth in retail.\n\nValuation-wise, Amazon isnâ€™t exactly a steal today, but a 30% run by the end of 2026 seems plausible if AWS continues to accelerate and AI adoption drives long-term cloud demand. The key risks remain competition from other cloud providers, regulatory pressures, and execution risk in balancing growth across retail, AWS, and advertising. Overall, your thesis aligns with the idea that **Amazonâ€™s future earnings power is understated by headline revenue numbers**, and the market may gradually catch up as AWS and AI adoption become more visible in earnings.'),(79,'ValueInvesting','1psb61l','nv88x59','2025-12-21',5,0.9761,'AMZN is on my watch list but its PE is still higher than GOOG with worse growth and worse catalysts.

Their Trainium range sucks and that includes V3 which they just released. Maybe v4 will be competitive but we\'ll have to see and by the point it releases it will be compared against Nvidia Rubin and TPU V8. They have a partnership with Anthropic but so does Google and Microsoft and so it\'s not a differentiator.\n\nA possible bear thesis is businesses migrating to Google or MSFT to use their exclusive models.
