There is a concentrated area downtown which has a number of apartment high rises and some shops. And there are some larger projects (notably Kenilworth in 20019 and Barry Frams in 20020), which although I ventured into a number of times, are....rough.\n\nIts a really complex problem. Its in part of DC called \'East of the (Anacostia) River\' or EOTR. And has historically been an impoverished black part of the city. Even in the 90s when all of DC was rough, this area was the worst of the worst. And because of the river its remained sectioned off, and even despite investments from DC, has been the slowest to proper in the thriving DC. The same reason that Amazon doesnt want to deliver there is the same reason its a food desert - crime. The most egregious corporate offender though was Walmart who agreed to put 2? stores in 20019 and 20020 back in \\~2017 if memory serves in exchange for puting stores in more affluent parts of DC. They built the stores they wanted and then reneged on the 2 others, and saw no consequences.\n\nI understand why Amazon doesn\'t feel like its safe to deliver there, but I had prime when I lived there, and it helped tremendously to offset the food/shopping desert. There needs to be stronger representation (Trayon White down in 20020 for example is a criminal who keeps getting relected), and more advocacy groups need to be vocal about the issues in this part of DC.\n\nI know this is a stock sub - this will be an immaterial lawsuite for amazon - but its a major social and political issue that many urban areas across the country face. These large companies need to be held at least somewhat accountable to provide equal services, they certainly get preferential treatment in our society, they should be helping to solve these issues not contributing to them, they certainly have the capital to do so.\n\nQuick note: I loved living in 20019 - understanding that I have a different perspective I am privileged (good income, white male) - the neighborhood was warm and welcoming, we would help each other out, and there were many genuinely kind people.

Those peers can fold AI into their businesses with almost no downside, while for Google the story feels more mixed.\n\nOn the upside, Google sits on a treasure trove of daily-use productsâ€”Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Photos, Android, YouTubeâ€”each ready for AI upgrades that could spawn brand-new revenue streams. The company still has an unmatched combination of data, research talent, and compute. And its long-term bets like Waymo, quantum chips, and the health portfolio suddenly look more plausible in an AI-first world.\n\nThe risk, though, is that Alphabetâ€™s ad machine is so big it almost crowds out everything else. If AI chat answers start stealing even a single-digit percentage of classic search queries, the revenue hit lands fast and hard, and Google Cloudâ€™s profit gap is still wide. Add in the inertia of changing a money printer this sizeâ€”without a â€œfounder-CEOâ€ to rip off the Band-Aidâ€”and you can see why some investors worry that execution will lag vision.\n\nAre the ads fears overblown?

The deeper you dig, the clearer it becomes that AWS is entering a high-growth phase, and the numbers back it up.\n\nKey context here is AWSâ€™s massive data center expansion.

Thatâ€™s a solid foundation for the growth thesis. \n\nTheyâ€™re pouring in capital too, about $33 billion in AWS capex in 2025, putting them neck-and-neck with Microsoft and Google in build-out intensity. And with AI workloads still constrained by GPU shortages, once supply loosens up, adoption could accelerate notably.\n\nOn valuation, AMZN trades at roughly 3.7Ã— EV/revenue and about 20Ã— EV/EBITDA, which is still reasonable compared to peers like Netflix and Meta that have already run higher. \n\nMorgan Stanley has Amazon as its top tech pick currently, boosting its price target from $250 to $300, with a bull case around $350. That\'s about 35â€“60% upside from current levels. \n\nSo, youâ€™re not blind-sighting here.
