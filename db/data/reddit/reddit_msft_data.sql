Microsoft is in luck, as switching your company wide azure which obviosly came with everything connected - identities, communication, etc - to some other providers is just a massive undertaking, so there still is slowness in the movement. However, it seems like growth and acquisition of new customers in eu are severely hindered in the short term.\n\nAn announcement like this has therefore to be read as damage control, to not lose too many customers and to not lose too many future customers as well. It will even help in legal considerations. However, the flight from ms is not driven by legality but by distrust on the side of eu based companies, to become and suffer as leverage in trumps dealings.
