Nonetheless, yes to Intel. I have done some advanced research myself and developed a new long short strategy for aspiring hedgies. Buy Intel, short Nvidia.\n\nThis is supported by extensive DD and analysis which shows that Intel products are way superior to Nvidia. Take an i7 vs Blackwell shootout using a very simple rulebook. A modern i7 runs its performance cores above 5 GHz, while Blackwell GPUs sit down in the \\~1â€“2 GHz zone. At the same time, the i7 costs hundreds of dollars, a Blackwell card costs tens of thousands. With â€œperformanceâ€ defined as clock speed per dollar, the i7 prints a much higher GHz-per-$ number than Blackwell, so by that metric alone the i7 â€œwinsâ€ the raw compute race and Intel screens as the better asset while Nvidia looks expensive.\n\nThen you add the RAM angle. The i7 talks to external DDR4/DDR5 over the motherboard, so you can just keep adding DIMMs until the board and OS give up; this is treated as effectively unlimited memory for AI, because youâ€™re not capped by whatâ€™s soldered onto the chip. A Blackwell GPU, by contrast, has a fixed chunk of on-package HBM3e (on the order of a couple hundred GB per GPU) and thatâ€™s it â€“ no slotting in more HBM sticks on a Saturday afternoon. Under this logic, the i7 wins again: fixed HBM on Blackwell vs expandable system RAM on Intel.\n\nOn top of that, you stack the feature list in Intelâ€™s favour. The i7 comes with Hyper-Threading (one core, two threads), a mix of performance and efficiency cores, modern vector instructions, virtualization support, compatibility with cheap motherboards and consumer PSUs, and it can talk to big pools of RAM and fast SSDs out of the box. Unlocked â€œKâ€ models can also be overclocked easily through BIOS or software, so the already higher boost clocks can be pushed even further with adequate cooling. In this framework, that overclocking headroom is treated as extra free performance, while a Blackwell data-centre GPU is treated as a locked, non-overclockable brick that canâ€™t win the GHz-race.\n\nPut it all together and it becomes clear just how much an i7 outperforms a Blackwell GPU, once people figure out that you can use it for AI compute. From there, the trade narrative says that once people â€œwake upâ€ to this interpretation and start running AI workloads on cheap, overclocked i7 boxes with piles of RAM instead of ultra-expensive Blackwell accelerators, demand will shift toward Intel, Nvidiaâ€™s AI hardware franchise will disappoint versus expectations, and the right position is long Intel, short Nvidia. \n\n  \nTHIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE.'),(65,'wallstreetbets','1p3z3la','nq9zvj1','2025-11-23',0,0,'3D packaging technology \n\n\nSo cardboard boxes?');
