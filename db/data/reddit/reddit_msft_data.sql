They\'re flashing the same bell curve this year. It\'s basically a threat to employees.\n\nFrom an employee perspective it turns your place into hunger games. It\'s no longer \"worker against the work\", it\'s \"worker against worker\".

So, again, it\'s really just a popularity contest, and the bottom 10% of people at work that are ugly, lack social skills or don\'t socialize enough to brag about their work end up getting the boot.\n\nThis especially bites companies in the rear when they have an entrenched culture that watches each others backs.
