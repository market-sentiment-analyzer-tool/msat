He added: â€œ25% will be paid to the United States of America.â€\n\nThe move is a boon for Nvidia, which has fought for months to maintain access to the worldâ€™s second-largest economy. The company had agreed earlier this year to give the U.S. 15% of the China sales from a lower-performing chip, only for the Chinese to scuttle those plans as part of continuing trade talks between the two sides. \n\nChips from the worldâ€™s most valuable company have become a prized geopolitical tool. The H200 has higher performance than the H20 that Nvidia was previously allowed to sellâ€”but it isnâ€™t as powerful as the companyâ€™s top Blackwell products released this year nor the Rubin generation of chips coming next year.\n\nThe move follows a meeting between Trump and Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang last week, where the pair discussed H200 exports, people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia shares added nearly 2% after hours.\n\nEven with the U.S. government taking a cut, the decision could be worth billions of dollars in sales to Nvidia, which enjoys comfortable margins on its artificial-intelligence chips. In the most recent fiscal quarter, Nvidia reported gross margins of 73.4% on $57 billion in sales, which includes a variety of hardware types, including chips from its Grace and Blackwell series, networking hardware and other products. \n\nIn August, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said that â€œif geopolitical issues subside,â€ the company could ship between $2 billion and $5 billion of chips to China per quarter, which could increase if orders pick up.\n\nThe exports could also help Chinese tech giants that have struggled to get top chips to train their models. Huang has argued Nvidia should be allowed to compete in the Chinese market because China has many of the worldâ€™s top AI researchers and the U.S. should want them using American technology.\n\nHuang has also made clear that the scale of AI demand in China makes the country critical for the companyâ€™s future. â€œYouâ€™re not going to replace China,â€ Huang said at an event at the think tank CSIS last week.\n\nTrump said the government would take a similar approach to exports from Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices as well as Intel, in which the government now owns a 10% stake after converting billions of dollars in grants to equity earlier this year. Intel isnâ€™t a major exporter of top AI chips. \n\nThe approval comes just weeks after administration officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio torpedoed a push from Nvidia to sell a slimmed-down Blackwell chip to China before a recent trade meeting between Trump and Chinaâ€™s Xi Jinping.\n\nSome officials including AI czar David Sacks and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have backed exporting the H200 because it could be a good compromise that allows Nvidia to compete with Chinaâ€™s Huawei Technologies without vaulting China past the U.S. in AI, people familiar with the discussions said. \n\nEarlier this year, after H20 exports were approved, China told its companies not to use the chips because of alleged security concerns. Some analysts viewed the Chinese message as a negotiating tactic to get a better chip like the H200. \n\nNvidia has been applying a full-court press to the Trump administration and lawmakers this year, seeking permission to send its valuable chips all over the world and arguing that the exports will ensure U.S. technology dominance. The company has antagonized some administration officials and others in Washington who feel it is giving priority to a sales bonanza over national-security concerns.\n\nâ€œThis decision to authorize H200 sales to China is so shortsighted,â€ said Aaron Bartnick, a former White House technology and security official during the Biden administration who is now at Columbia University. He said he thinks the move will significantly advance Chinaâ€™s chip capabilities and it doesnâ€™t seem like the U.S. got much of consequence in return for allowing the exports.\n\nThe think tank Institute for Progress estimates that the H200 is almost six times as powerful as the H20. Newer generations of the companyâ€™s products often improve sharply. The Biden administration imposed export restrictions on crucial chips that many analysts credit with limiting Chinaâ€™s domestic semiconductor and AI capabilities. \n\nAlso on Monday, the Justice Department announced a sweeping crackdown on smuggling of Nvidia chips, including the newly legalized H200.\n\nThe government said that Alan Hao Hsu, a Houston businessman, had pleaded guilty to smuggling more than $160 million worth of Nvidia H100 and H200 chips, which officials said â€œare used for both civilian and military applications.â€\n\nIn addition, federal law-enforcement officers have arrested two Chinese businessmen living in the U.S. and Canada as part of the dragnet, charging them with violating the Export Control Reform Act by shipping banned Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, to China through Hong Kong using falsified labels.\n\nThe prosecutions underscore the severity with which smugglers of Nvidiaâ€™s AI chips were treated when caught violating the export controls that have now been loosened.'),(57,'wallstreetbets','1pi2gk2','nt3g4dk','2025-12-09',74,0.6249,'25% cut ?\n\nIn other news it would be a tax.
