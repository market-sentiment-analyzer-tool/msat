My perspective.  An analysis I did this morning.\n\nTwo issues: demand for profit-generating #GPUs and demand for #AI.\n\nThe anchor is NVIDIA, priced to 30% CAGR profit growth for 4 more years. Their revenues are primarily sourced from hyperscalers\' ops CF. Hyperscalers steadily increase CapEx, likely creating a demand floor. Companies like Meta face existential threats, forcing costly debt-fueled spend.\n\nHyperscalers face an accounting squeeze from GPU depreciation. NVidia\'s generation cycles are compressing from 3 yrs to 1, with generational efficiency improvements at 90%. If hyperscalers depreciate GPUs over 6 years, this mismatch creates an earnings crush. If latest generation CPU demand remains high, older GPUs have low revenue while still depreciating at current rates.\n\nGoogle, AMD, Intel Corporation, and the hyperscalers have their own GPU build-out. Substitutes are 2 years out and a generation behind; this presses NVIDIA into excess R&D to maintain its advantage. NVidia\'s smartest move was saturating TSMC\'s 2nm reserve; TSMC is the lynchpin for controlling the GPU supply chain.\n\nNot discussed: risk from circular deal-making on inflated EV, and #OpenAI\'s unrealistic datacenter commitments.\n\nThe #AI demand problem: short-term over-optimism melded with long-term over-pessimismâ€”a volatile mix.\n\nWhile MIT claims 12% of jobs are replaceable by AI today, reality lags. Enterprise adoption is 9+ months for simple uses. Adoption is blocked by: emergent AI, context rot, insufficient infosec, sovereign/localized AI, local hosting, agentic reliability, and org know-how. In Akka\'s 20 enterprise deployments, only half use foundry models for use cases that cannot replace workers.\n\nThe physics of compute efficiency, cost curves, and privacy incentives all point toward a future where AI inference runs locally. This creates existential risk for cloud-first AI companies and those betting on centralized data centers.\n\nPrivacy and geopolitical risks are driving govts away to air-gapped solutions. They have substantial dollars and fear continuous surveillance or cloud lock-in. When local AI gets fast enough on cost-effective machines, the market will flip, further pressuring hyperscaler margins.\n\nConsumer demand is hard to predict. Most are irritated by AI, yet ChatGPT wasn\'t discussed 3 years ago. The industry needs AI to be great for the consumer and will \'will\' it into existence. As LLMs double their abilities every 7 months, forecasting the productivity of a 32x LLM is tough.\n\nMarket: underestimating long-term AI demand while overestimating near-term demand, the industry\'s spend on premium GPUs, and how long cloud-AI vendors can hold pricing power.\n\nThe market will probably dramatically appreciate over the next 18 months before an inevitable, painful mean reversion.'),(10,'investing','1p9xnq5','nrfgxmv','2025-11-29',7,0,'Priced in'),(11,'investing','1p9xnq5','nrffr53','2025-11-29',9,0.8131,'Born and raised USA here...

This is obviously nonsense from just a common sense perspective but more importantly, it is not what is happening as the cloud providers are actually using the GPUs for much longer than 3 years. GPUs have different use cases ranging from computationally most intensive to less intensive. When it comes to AI, for instance, they can use their latest GPUs for model training, older ones for inference, etc. But then Azure et al. are of course offering services beyond AI and can use their oldest GPUs for more mundane tasks and so on. So if we look at the following calculation:\n\n- $17B in GPUs depreciated over 6 years = $2.8 B/year expense\n- If economic life is really 3 years = $5.7B/year expense\nThe difference: $2.9B/year in overstated earnings\n\nThe conclusion here that this would imply â€œoverstated earningsâ€ would be true IF they actually threw all GPUs in the trash after 3 years AND buy new ones as replacement. This is obviously not what is happening unless you want to accuse them of cooking the books. \n\nI havenâ€™t seen a discussion about _rate_ of depreciation. Obviously the older the GPUs the less money they can make but the function may not be linear as accounting assumes? Perhaps it could be worthwhile to have a closer look at that but the argument as laid out by OP makes no sense unless accounting fraud is being assumed.'),(42,'ValueInvesting','1p9ks0t','nrcwdea','2025-11-29',2,0.7912,'Okay but why does michael burry have a monopoly on truth when it comes to the depreciation of these assets?
