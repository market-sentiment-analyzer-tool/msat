Thatâ€™s not it verbatim, but you know what Iâ€™m saying. Everyone has different risk tolerances, everyone has different goals. \n\n* If putting all your money in VOO keeps you up at night then donâ€™t do it. Yes, I said that. Itâ€™s not a typo. I donâ€™t care what the forum says, if youâ€™re stressing yourself out and giving yourself an ulcer, then itâ€™s a bad strategy no matter what the mechanics of the strategy actually are. Your comfort level is the most important thing in your investing life.\n\n* however, that means that different people can have completely different strategies. Because those are what make you feel better and allow you to go to sleep at night. I got no problem with VOO and go away. But like I said, if that is a strategy that keeps you up and does not fit your personality or risk profile or needs, then itâ€™s a bad strategy. Itâ€™s as simple as that. Itâ€™s bad for **you**. You can argue all you want that itâ€™s perfect and you canâ€™t get better, but if youâ€™re dead in a box, then itâ€™s not very good.\n\n* so different people have different strategies. And on one hand youâ€™re saying itâ€™s good that you went with whatâ€™s comfortable and makes you feel best. But then youâ€™re also saying only if your choices coincide with what my choices are. What makes me feel best must be what makes you feel best. This isnâ€™t about 10 year return and historical averages, this is about you continuing to invest and being comfortable with your decisions.\n\n* so I know this is a shocker, but thereâ€™s gonna be a lot of people who arenâ€™t comfortable with the most boring investment methods in existence. Because itâ€™s right there in the description. Theyâ€™re not looking every day to see if they lost money. Theyâ€™re looking every day to see, the opportunities they missed. And If it keeps you awake and it stresses you out, the reasons donâ€™t matter. You gotta get comfortable with your investments.\n\n* that said, there are strategies that we should advise against, even if the individual is comfortable using them. Like taking all your money and stapling it to your jacket and walking around blindfolded in dangerous neighborhoods. You might really like that for some reason and think itâ€™s a sound investment strategy, but, I think the forum should probably advise against it.\n\n* but go to your comfort level. And if youâ€™re comfort level **isnâ€™t** sitting on VOO for 25 years, then donâ€™t do it. We can scream until weâ€™re blue in the faces about how stable and reliable it is (and we should highlight those things) but if it doesnâ€™t work for someone then find alternatives.'),(14,'investing','1fyv1l0','lqzp13o','2024-10-08',3,0,'GO 100% VT in the Roth\n\nand IF you can invest more, add that to a taxable VTI/VXUS\n\nEveryone on reddit posting the \"rate my portfolio\" will never beat the above'),(15,'investing','1fyv1l0','lqxdgtw','2024-10-08',7,0.3699,'Yes.
