Around the 29 minute mark, they talk about scaling limitations and \"why not just go an order of magnitude bigger right away?\".\n\nDemis explains that there are practical limits you run into at that level, such as how much compute can you fit in one datacenter, \"interesting distributed computing challenges\".  \"We have our TPUs that we\'re building on and designing all the time, **as well as using GPUs**\". Why would they ever use GPUs if their TPUs were definitively better? I actually have no certain answer here so would welcome insight, but the fact they still use GPUs says a lot.\n\n\nIt really isn\'t as simple as $/compute, because when compute goes 10x-100x, the costs (and capabilities) don\'t trend smoothly (read: there are many more challenges than just making performant silicon)\n\n\nSo, the apple rumors are definitely good for Google, but I wouldn\'t read through that they are bad for others.

This is a great, well-timed comparison of the how the AI infrastructure industry is forming and attempting to re shape itself.   Making sense of the CEO Speak.\n\nIn high tech, you’re either the best performance or the lowest cost.  Guys in the middle are “tweeners” or in between, offering neither the best performance nor the lowest cost and they typically don’t last too long.  Broadcom is definitely going for the value sell here.\n\nNvidia OTOH is building a Formula1 car for the F1 race, custom everything, but it\'s expensive.  I see Nvidia’s approach of the problem as holistic, they take apart and analyze every switch and every cycle to wring the best performance out of the entire solution, much like optimizing game performance.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) is coming to the party with a handful of assets:  Networking, custom silicon capabilities, software, compute, memory interfaces, system architecture, and an argument that the AI market is too expensive.  Their bone fides are that they are the partner building Google’s TPU.  Their compelling pitch, imho, is they are offering interchangeability, plug and play with different off the shelf parts to build your AI supercomputer.\n\nAVGO’s pitch is hey!, we’re pretty good at this.  We have all this experience and assets and we can help you (GOOG, META, MSFT) with your custom parts.  You don’t need to beat Nvidia, you just need ***good enough***.\n\nThe **tl;dr is Nvidia is best and costs like it.   But for “anyone who was betting that Nvidia would become a large market share donor in AI in the coming years, this isn’t going to happen anytime soon. “**\n\nAVGO seems to want to convince customers that lower performance solutions are perfectly acceptable.    For example PCI vs NVLink (which is 5x faster) for chip to chip communications, saying effectively commercial off the shelf solutions (COTS) are good enough for leading AI workloads.\n\nJensen’s strategy is keep raising the bar, run faster, out innovate everyone.   This seems a reasonable strategy if everyone is chasing larger LLMs on the way to AGI.\n\nWhat the other camp is trying to convince the world of is that the algorithms are basically already quantified, that it’s just a matter of tying these parts together in an economical way, and we have all the experience and expertise needed.  They are betting that the big strides in development are in the past, all there is to know, and if not, spend your money with us anyway, and we can learn together.   It’s like saying you don’t need a Formula1 car to compete in a Formula1 race, this Porsche street car is fine!\n\nThe admissions in weakness to this strategy, made by AVGO execs from whom the author snipped quotes, was a bit surprising to me:\n\n* “general processors are actually too powerful” - never heard that before!\n* He makes this point several times: “when you customize it, you can actually significantly cut the size and power.” - to which I respond, it’s just physics.  Cut the size and power and you cut performance too.\n* “the different aspects of an XPU. Number one, compute. We have developed a flow to optimize the architectural construction of that compute. **We have several software engineers in my team**, all they do is optimize the flow to build those accelerators” — This is almost hilarious.  Nvidia has entire departments dedicating to optimizing, not “several guys.”\n* He actually admits PCI is not that great for chip to chip communication and rolls out a bandaid:  “We built a native capability for optics so that you don\'t need to have a DSP or a retimer”\n\nThis is just a weird take from AVGO in my view.  They aren\'t communicating like the understand the AI problem and solutions, but instead, think cost will become the overriding factor.   Maybe he\'s right?  We\'ll see.   But I don\'t see how this serves them well as workloads continue to ratchet up in number of parameters.   The tide will obviously shift when Nvidia caves and has to pivot on pricing.

I’m not going to go full deep dive since I’m banging this out on my phone but at a high level the big networking technologies relevant to NVIDIA are:\n\nInfiniBand: nobody else has IB and no one will. They bought Mellanox a few years ago and own the full stack. This is the standard for high performance interconnect for HPC/AI cluster type workloads where low latency is key (Google MPI for bonus reading). There are some alternatives that will never be mainstream OmniPath from Cornelis Networks (formerly Intel) and Slingshot from HPE which is on gen 2 with gen 3 dev way behind schedule. \n\nNVLink which is their chip to chip or GPU to GPU fabric. This exists because PCIe is relatively slow. DGX uses this and you’ll see it listed as SXM and then a generation. Basically 8 GPUs are soldered onto the same PCB. AMD is a ways behind but is going to have similar-ish tech with infinity fabric\n\nDPU/NPU/IPU/xPU these are processors other than GPU or CPU and they’re typically mounted on a NIC. NVIDIA calls theirs Bluefield and it’s been kind of vaporware in the industry so far. BF3 looks real and they’ll force it on you with their SpectrumX Ethernet product line. Net-net these products are about offloading functions from other more expensive compute. Everybody has one, but NVIDIA has the full ecosystem. \n\nEthernet is an open standard for networking and is the most broadly deployed networking tech in the world. Everybody makes this (Broadcom, Juniper, Cisco, NVIDIA, etc). The big problem for Ethernet isn’t bandwidth it’s latency because it’s an old. Which is why InfiniBand is so dominant in HPC. Many big players have formed the Ultra Ethernet Coalition to flatten the Ethernet stack and reduce latency making it more competitive with IB. NVIDIA is not part of the UEC but they could join in the future.

Morgan Stanley**\n\nOther shorter term comments include:\n\n* HBM 3e supply is not a concern, even as we are constrained near term. The company remains highly confident that they will qualify their 3rd HBM3e supplier (Samsung, covered by Shawn Kim), and with or without that incremental supply the company sees an HBM3e ramp that will not be a bottleneck after the first couple of quarters. HBM3e will commoditize somewhat with more suppliers and a lack of shortage.\n\n* Air cooled racks - NVL36 - will be shipping in volume as a large portion of January quarter revenues. Liquid cooled progress is good, with all the building blocks coming together, but it\'s a major transition that takes a bit longer. Longer term liquid cooled NVL72 is expected to be the main workhorse of the blackwell lineup.\n* While our Asia team has heard of roadmap adjustments to products that were never officially announced, such as B200A or NVL36x2, we were told there are no major changes to the roadmap; our sense is that any tweaks are simply designed to optimize around the products that customers want most. Confirmed the name change from Blackwell Ultra to GB300, but that\'s strictly a name change with no implications for the roadmap.\n\n* Foundry sourcing remains heavily focused on TSMC, covered by Charlie Chan, with less Samsung dependence and Intel projects small and a couple of years away.\n\n* Gross margins, per CFO commentary, are as described, with modest pressure this quarter and next around the ramp of newer lower yield products; we model next year\'s gross margins at the same level that we exit this year, but we maintain the belief that this may prove conservative.\n\n* Management does not know if there will be incremental export controls on the China-based H20, but it does not seem to be a major concern. The choice to ramp H20 at lower price points when there is plenty of Hopper demand elsewhere was negative for margins, but NVIDIA wants to serve demand in all regions. If they are forced to move Hopper supply to higher price points it does not appear to be a meaningful earnings variance.\n\nThoughts on the stock: The stock has been very robust of late, and we are almost back to the all time highs. We have seen sentiment swing back to the positive levels as well, as the very strong supply chain commentary is being matched with obvious hyperscaler demand, and our incoming call volume on NVIDIA (at least up until this NDR) had dropped, which tends to indicate complacent and positive views.\n\nWe remain very bullish longer term, but would concede given the rally that shorter term upside from here raises the bar on earnings somewhat. Our enthusiasm for the stock remains highest when there are short term debates that can be quickly resolved, such as the gross margin pressures around the quarter, lead time issues, or product ramp issues. When consensus shifts to very high CY25 expectations - where we are right now - the debate tends to shift to CY26 and beyond. While we are optimistic on longer term prospects, those debates are harder to resolve.\n\nThe company has very clearly been coming in $2 bn ahead of their guidance each quarter, with gross margins 1 point or more above guidance, with regularity, and that has become the expectation. (The one exception on gross margin was last quarter, where gross margins were only slightly higher than guidance, which caused some consternation - but a large number of Blackwell rev 0 wafers were scrapped, which seems a one time event). At some point, the magnitude of upside is likely to climb, and there are some indications that this could be a quarter with more upside, but we would expect very conservative revenue treatment, and are not ready to drive up expectations just yet. So we would keep our near term expectations for more of the same, rather than a breakout to a new level.\n\nAll those caveats having been said, this is still an exceptional situation, with AI the most important trend in technology, and NVIDIA unquestionably the biggest beneficiary of those investments; we would be careful about applying commodity cyclical frameworks when the pace of investment continues to elevate.\n\n**As a result, NVIDIA remains our top pick in semis, Overweight rated, with a $150 target.**'),(576,'NVDA_Stock','1g0okso','lra8vdn','2024-10-10',9,0.9994,'**PART 1.  Morgan Stanley**\n\nThis week we hosted Nvidia CEO for a 3 day non deal road show. Long term confidence remains high, with management highlighting new opportunities derived from the complexity of inference scaling exponentially with \"long thinking\".\n\nKey takeaways\n\n* Every indication from management is that we are still early in a long term AI investment cycle\n\n* Newest element is the much more complex inference coming from \"long thinking\", inference interactions requiring substantially more computation\n\n* Blackwell systems NVL36/72 remains the best solution for those challenges, providing systems level differentiation vs. merchant and custom alternatives.\n\n* **Shorter term, Blackwell ramp progressing on schedule with that product sold out next 12 months, pointing to continued strong conditions**\n\n* Remain OW, remains our Top Pick in semis\n\nThis week we hosted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress and other members of the management team for a three day NDR in New York City. It\'s no surprise that management enthusiasm remains high both short term and long term, with the strong sense that there is still material growth ahead. Perhaps the newest element of the story is the view that inference is starting to solve much more complex problems which will require a much richer mix of hardware - with NVIDIA\'s upcoming rack scale products as an optimal solution. The longer term vision is that deep thinking will allow every company in the world to hire large numbers of \"digital AI employees\" that can execute challenging tasks.\n\nThe high cost of scaling training clusters has been an element of the positive trends in the last 12 months, and the explosive adoption of higher end GPUs in Gen AI inference has also been a positive. But the notion that a more thoughtful, task oriented inference would cause an exponential jump in inference complexity strikes us an important new avenue for growth, and another clear area where NVIDIA\'s full stack approach to solving these problems adds to the company\'s considerable lead.\n\nWe share some detail on those evolutions below, but the clear view continues to be that we are set up for an exceptionally strong 2025 that management characterizes as an early stage of a long term investment cycle - Jensen did make it clear that he expects growth again in 2026, though he did not quantify.\n\nCould inference compute scale exponentially with \"long thinking\"? Throughout our meetings Jensen frequently referenced the recently released o1 model (also known as strawberry) from open-ai, which can produce a chain of thought before responding to queries. Unencumbering model output from latency constraints and enabling the model to \"think\" as long as it needs to before responding. Per Open-AI: \"We have found that the performance of o1 consistently improves with more reinforcement learning (train-time compute) and with more time spent thinking (test-time compute)\". Open-AI has never been explicit about the cost differential from o1 inference, but some sources suggest it could be somewhere in the 10x range vs GPT-4. And more importantly for the Nvidia growth story as exciting as the capabilities on the o1 preview are the model is simply too slow and too expensive for developers to see it as a viable option for building a consumer facing applications that have any kind of latency concern (with the caveat that OAI has smaller o1-mini model which is more competitive).\n\nThe bigger picture is the Nvidia team is excited about what a model trained on a Blackwell or Rubin system will be able to enable two three or four generations from now. With o1 a GPT-4 class model (GPT-4 was trained in 2022 on A100s) the advances we\'ve made in hardware over the last few years haven\'t really shown up in their entirety yet. And for inference we can only speculate as to the incremental compute will it take to serve a GPT-6 class model with these advanced capabilities at low latency. But it seems likely that its going to be an order of magnitude more compute intensive than what we consider leading edge today. And Nvidia is not talking specifically about open-ai, the o1 model just serves as an example of where the company thinks LLMs are headed and the new inference scaling law they see as a huge boon to the business over time.\n\nWhat does a more thoughtful inference enable? The NVIDIA long term vision articulated here is that all enterprises ten years from now will have thousands of \"digital employees\" doing very difficult tasks - programmers, circuit designers, marketing program managers, paralegals, etc. will be treated like humans. Businesses will be run with humans talking to AIs, AIs talking to AIs, humans talking to humans.\n\nScaling up this agent intelligence requires both more sophisticated training, but also increasingly more sophisticated inference. Inference comes more than conversational transactions, more about doing highly complex tasks that can require multiple attempts.\n\nEven workloads that seemed solved a few years ago will now require much more complicated compute with these approaches. Computer vision was considered to be \"computationally solved\" a few years ago, but the ability to take that image recognition and apply human or superhuman thought/interpretation still eludes us. In Jensen\'s words, computer vision has been solved for the fruit fly brain as image recognition improves, but to get to the understanding human brains we still have a long way to go. That is even more the case when it comes to the most complex multimodal generational AI tasks.\n\nAll of this drives much more complex inference which implies significantly higher investment requirements into inference hardware.\n\nNVIDIA is positioning Blackwell - in particular the rack scale systems - as breakthrough technology for solving these problems. Blackwell brings a much more capable processor to the AI markets, but the most important innovation could come from the GB200 systems incorporating a \"full rack\" approach. By introducing the Grace CPU into the system, as well as a much higher complexity NVLink chip to chip connectivity, the company is enabling 36 or 72 GPU racks that have each GPU talking to all of the other GPUs at the same time, putting all of the GPUs in the same NVLink domain and dramatically enhancing the ability to treat the entire rack as a massive GPU.\n\nOf course, all of that has been known since GTC in March, but the company insists that other solutions that lack this system integration capability - including all merchant competitors and most custom silicon competitors other than Google\'s TPU - will struggle to meet the new requirements of these new models.\n\nOur view continues to be that NVIDIA is likely to actually gain share of AI processors in 2025, as the biggest users of custom silicon are seeing very steep ramps with NVIDIA solutions next year. Everything that we heard this week reinforced that.\n\nIn the shorter term, the Blackwell ramp appears to be quite strong, with no major changes to the roadmaps and every indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility, in line with all of our checks. Issues with initial Blackwell silicon are now totally behind us. Management did give some color on the initial ramp issues with Blackwell; the first version of silicon was functional, but had very low yields; importantly, the yield problems were mostly discovered post packaging, which meant that scrapped product would require a loss of CoWoS and HBM3e, both overall supply constraints at the moment. But those issues are behind the company and there is high conviction in prior guidance that they will have several billion in Blackwell revenue in the January quarter.\n\nAny new Blackwell orders now that aren\'t already in queue will be shipped late next year, as they are booked out 12 months or so, which continues to drive strong short term demand for Hopper which will still be a major factor though the year. While there was no new short term revenue or margin commentary, this view obviously portends continued high growth in shipment trends through the year.'),(577,'NVDA_Stock','1g0okso','lrb7s7j','2024-10-10',3,0.807,'Great thanks for posting!'),(578,'NVDA_Stock','1g0okso','lrbfj1r','2024-10-10',2,0.2732,'This is the kinda content I thrive for in this sub.

GPT4 to GPT6 will be orders of magnitude. More GPUs.\n\n4. More and more complex applications. We saw this in, what was it called, Computex? Weather simulations, physics, biochemistry, genetics, proteins, pharmaceuticals. They just had an article the other day about simulating semiconductor photolitho mask designs. Insanity.

The racks (the new massive chip, call it Silicon-in-Rack), the connections, the cooling, the design of the chips, the software, etc. itâ€™s easy to see where they are headed: an entire data center of entirely interconnected GPUs. One massive GPU consisting of thousands or even millions of Blackwell equivalent chips.\n\nBottom line is this AI boom is just starting and it will never end.

CNBC will be on the ground. Based on the speaking agenda and announcements leading up to the conference, AI tools to conquer administrative burdens will be the star of this yearâ€™s show. \n\nDoctors and nurses are responsible for mountains of documentation as they work to keep up with patient records, interface with insurance companies and comply with regulators. Often, these tasks are painstakingly manual, in part because health data is siloed and stored across multiple vendors and formats. \n\nThe daunting administrative workload is a major cause of burnout in the industry, and itâ€™s part of the reason a nationwide shortage of 100,000 health-care workers is expected by 2028, according to consulting firm Mercer. Tech companies, eager to carve out a piece of a market that could top $6.8 trillion in spending by the decadeâ€™s end, argue that their generative AI tools can help.\n\nGoogle, for instance, said itâ€™s working to expand its health-care customer base by tackling administrative burden with AI.\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced the general availability of Vertex AI Search for Healthcare, which it introduced in a trial capacity during HLTH last year. Vertex AI Search for Healthcare allows developers to build tools to help doctors quickly search for information across disparate medical records, Google said. New features within Googleâ€™s Healthcare Data Engine, which helps organizations build the platforms they need to support generative AI, are also now available, the company said.\n\nGoogle on Thursday released the results of a survey that said clinicians spend nearly 28 hours a week on administrative tasks. In the survey, 80% of providers said this clerical work takes away from their time with patients, and 91% said they feel positive about using AI to streamline these tasks. \n\nSimilarly, Microsoft on Oct. 11 announced its collection of tools that aim to lessen cliniciansâ€™ administrative workload, including medical imaging models, a health-care agent service and an automated documentation solution for nurses, most of which are still in the early stages of development. \n\nMicrosoft already offers an automated documentation tool for doctors through its subsidiary, Nuance Communications, which it acquired in a $16 billion deal in 2021. The tool, called DAX Copilot, uses AI to transcribe doctorsâ€™ visits with patients and turn them into clinical notes and summaries. Ideally, this means doctors donâ€™t have to spend time typing out these notes themselves. \n\nNurses and doctors complete different types of documentation during their shifts, so Microsoft said itâ€™s building a separate tool for nurses thatâ€™s best suited to their workflows. \n\nAI scribe tools such as DAX Copilot have exploded in popularity this year, and Nuanceâ€™s competitors, such as Abridge, which has reportedly raised more than $460 million, and Suki, which has raised $165 million, will also be at the HLTH conference. \n\nDr. Shiv Rao, the founder and CEO of Abridge, told CNBC in March that the rate at which the health-care industry has adopted this new form of clinical documentation feels â€œhistoric.â€ Abridge received a coveted investment from Nvidiaâ€™s venture capital arm that same month. \n\nNvidia is also gearing up to address doctor and nurse workloads at HLTH. \n\nKimberly Powell, the companyâ€™s vice president of health care, is delivering a keynote Monday that will explain how using generative AI will help health-care professionals â€œdedicate more time to patient care,â€ according to the conferenceâ€™s website.\n\nNvidiaâ€™s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are used to create and deploy the models that power OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT and similar applications. As a result, Nvidia has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the AI boom. Nvidia shares are up more than 150% year to date, and the stock tripled last year. \n\nThe company has been making steady inroads into the health-care sector in recent years, and it offers a range of AI tools across medical devices, drug discovery, genomics and medical imaging. Nvidia also announced expanded partnerships with companies such as Johnson & Johnson\n and GE HealthCare\n in March. \n\nWhile the health-care sector has historically been slow to adopt new technology, the buzz around administrative AI tools has been undeniable since ChatGPT exploded onto the scene two years ago. \n\nEven so, many health systems are still in the early stages of evaluating tools and vendors, and theyâ€™ll be making the rounds on the HLTH exhibition floor. Tech companies will have to prove they have the chops to tackle one of health careâ€™s most complex problems.'),(846,'NVDA_Stock','1g7he9f','lsqxqbh','2024-10-19',6,-0.4939,'Has anyone told you that Nvidia chips have insane demand, today?'),(847,'NVDA_Stock','1g7he9f','lsqzoot','2024-10-19',2,0,'Is this a press release?'),(848,'NVDA_Stock','1g80f04','lsusv5o','2024-10-20',1,0.545,'Usually this fall under Rule 3: No open ended personal advice threads and Rule 7: No Low Quality Content, but its content is just barely over the low quality standard, so I\'ll allow it for this time.  \n\nFuture ones better be higher quality, either by justifying via new revenue streams, mathematical FCF models etc or it will be removed and warning issued for no substantiation.'),(849,'NVDA_Stock','1g80f04','lsus6oj','2024-10-20',19,0.982,'That old thread was really interesting - thanks for sharing!

These replicants are designed to perform tasks that humans either cannot or do not want to do, such as dangerous labor in off-world colonies. Replicants are virtually indistinguishable from humans but are given limited lifespans (typically four years).\n	â€¢	Blade Runners: The story follows Rick Deckard, a â€œblade runner,â€ who is part of a special police unit tasked with hunting down and â€œretiringâ€ (a euphemism for killing) replicants who escape to Earth, as they are banned from the planet due to fears of rebellion or violence.\n	â€¢	Themes of Identity and Humanity: The film explores profound philosophical themes related to the nature of humanity, consciousness, and the ethics of creating life. Replicants are portrayed as struggling with their predetermined lifespans and often exhibit more humanity and emotional depth than their human counterparts, raising questions about what it truly means to be human.\n\nDystopian Elements:\n\n	â€¢	Environmental Decline: The world of Blade Runner is depicted as grim and polluted, with constant rain, poor air quality, and minimal natural elements. The Earth is shown to be a declining planet, with many humans migrating to off-world colonies.\n	â€¢	Class Divide: There is a stark contrast between the wealthy, powerful elite (such as Tyrell) who live in high towers above the city and the struggling masses in the overpopulated, dilapidated streets below.\n	â€¢	Technological Overload: Society is dominated by large corporations and filled with towering, neon advertisements, showcasing how commercialism and technological advancements have saturated daily life.\n\nBlade Runner is now regarded as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time for its exploration of these themes, its striking visual style, and its lasting impact on the genre.'),(854,'NVDA_Stock','1g80f04','lsvikxx','2024-10-20',6,-0.1877,'As Jensen stated, billion dollar industries that have not even been created yet will be born.'),(855,'NVDA_Stock','1g80f04','lswokzk','2024-10-20',4,0.9201,'Let\'s check this against fundamentals and \"reasonable\" assumptions.  \n  \nWorldwide GDP is over 100T.

For Nvidia, those three areas â€œmove the needle most profoundly,â€ he said. â€œWhen itâ€™s our most impactful work, itâ€™s easiest to get energy around it.â€\n\nHuang was interviewed onstage by Daryl Plummer, a distinguished vice president, chief of research and fellow at Gartner.\n\nIn the long term, Nvidia is creating what Huang calls its own â€œAI brain.â€ Thatâ€™s the idea that knowledge of how a company works, its business processes and customer interactions need to be collected and turned over to AI. The end goal is to turn that information into an AI that CIOs and CEOs â€œcan just talk to,â€ Huang said.\n\nNvidia has already started turning all of its private data into an AI, Huang said, adding that â€œeverybody should do that.â€\n\nIn service of that goal, the company is announcing a tool that makes PDF files easier for AI to understand and ingest, Huang said. For the most part, â€œunstructured dataâ€ like emails and PDFs have been difficult for more traditional types of AI to capture.\n\nFurther down the line, it also means companies will have â€œlarge populations of digital workers,â€ or AI agents, working alongside their human counterparts, Huang said. To get there, everyoneâ€”including business technology leadersâ€”needs to learn how to instruct an AI.\n\nâ€œYouâ€™re still going to be doing programming,â€ he said. â€œBut you will be programming some kind of a structured way of communicating with AIs.â€'),(955,'NVDA_Stock','1g9oj7r','lt7o24o','2024-10-22',6,0.8057,'Iâ€™ve been banging the AI drum at my company for two years.
