The reoccurring revenue bullet point is an interesting one, but it falls into the same category as to why banks do not rent out homes. It is more profitable for a bank to sell you the loan than it is to rent out the house. For Nvidia, it is more profitable for them to design and sell the chips that it is to rent out the compute.
