Around the 29 minute mark, they talk about scaling limitations and \"why not just go an order of magnitude bigger right away?\".\n\nDemis explains that there are practical limits you run into at that level, such as how much compute can you fit in one datacenter, \"interesting distributed computing challenges\".  \"We have our TPUs that we\'re building on and designing all the time, **as well as using GPUs**\". Why would they ever use GPUs if their TPUs were definitively better? I actually have no certain answer here so would welcome insight, but the fact they still use GPUs says a lot.\n\n\nIt really isn\'t as simple as $/compute, because when compute goes 10x-100x, the costs (and capabilities) don\'t trend smoothly (read: there are many more challenges than just making performant silicon)\n\n\nSo, the apple rumors are definitely good for Google, but I wouldn\'t read through that they are bad for others.

This is a great, well-timed comparison of the how the AI infrastructure industry is forming and attempting to re shape itself.   Making sense of the CEO Speak.\n\nIn high tech, you’re either the best performance or the lowest cost.  Guys in the middle are “tweeners” or in between, offering neither the best performance nor the lowest cost and they typically don’t last too long.  Broadcom is definitely going for the value sell here.\n\nNvidia OTOH is building a Formula1 car for the F1 race, custom everything, but it\'s expensive.  I see Nvidia’s approach of the problem as holistic, they take apart and analyze every switch and every cycle to wring the best performance out of the entire solution, much like optimizing game performance.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) is coming to the party with a handful of assets:  Networking, custom silicon capabilities, software, compute, memory interfaces, system architecture, and an argument that the AI market is too expensive.  Their bone fides are that they are the partner building Google’s TPU.  Their compelling pitch, imho, is they are offering interchangeability, plug and play with different off the shelf parts to build your AI supercomputer.\n\nAVGO’s pitch is hey!, we’re pretty good at this.  We have all this experience and assets and we can help you (GOOG, META, MSFT) with your custom parts.  You don’t need to beat Nvidia, you just need ***good enough***.\n\nThe **tl;dr is Nvidia is best and costs like it.   But for “anyone who was betting that Nvidia would become a large market share donor in AI in the coming years, this isn’t going to happen anytime soon. “**\n\nAVGO seems to want to convince customers that lower performance solutions are perfectly acceptable.    For example PCI vs NVLink (which is 5x faster) for chip to chip communications, saying effectively commercial off the shelf solutions (COTS) are good enough for leading AI workloads.\n\nJensen’s strategy is keep raising the bar, run faster, out innovate everyone.   This seems a reasonable strategy if everyone is chasing larger LLMs on the way to AGI.\n\nWhat the other camp is trying to convince the world of is that the algorithms are basically already quantified, that it’s just a matter of tying these parts together in an economical way, and we have all the experience and expertise needed.  They are betting that the big strides in development are in the past, all there is to know, and if not, spend your money with us anyway, and we can learn together.   It’s like saying you don’t need a Formula1 car to compete in a Formula1 race, this Porsche street car is fine!\n\nThe admissions in weakness to this strategy, made by AVGO execs from whom the author snipped quotes, was a bit surprising to me:\n\n* “general processors are actually too powerful” - never heard that before!\n* He makes this point several times: “when you customize it, you can actually significantly cut the size and power.” - to which I respond, it’s just physics.  Cut the size and power and you cut performance too.\n* “the different aspects of an XPU. Number one, compute. We have developed a flow to optimize the architectural construction of that compute. **We have several software engineers in my team**, all they do is optimize the flow to build those accelerators” — This is almost hilarious.  Nvidia has entire departments dedicating to optimizing, not “several guys.”\n* He actually admits PCI is not that great for chip to chip communication and rolls out a bandaid:  “We built a native capability for optics so that you don\'t need to have a DSP or a retimer”\n\nThis is just a weird take from AVGO in my view.  They aren\'t communicating like the understand the AI problem and solutions, but instead, think cost will become the overriding factor.   Maybe he\'s right?  We\'ll see.   But I don\'t see how this serves them well as workloads continue to ratchet up in number of parameters.   The tide will obviously shift when Nvidia caves and has to pivot on pricing.

I’m not going to go full deep dive since I’m banging this out on my phone but at a high level the big networking technologies relevant to NVIDIA are:\n\nInfiniBand: nobody else has IB and no one will. They bought Mellanox a few years ago and own the full stack. This is the standard for high performance interconnect for HPC/AI cluster type workloads where low latency is key (Google MPI for bonus reading). There are some alternatives that will never be mainstream OmniPath from Cornelis Networks (formerly Intel) and Slingshot from HPE which is on gen 2 with gen 3 dev way behind schedule. \n\nNVLink which is their chip to chip or GPU to GPU fabric. This exists because PCIe is relatively slow. DGX uses this and you’ll see it listed as SXM and then a generation. Basically 8 GPUs are soldered onto the same PCB. AMD is a ways behind but is going to have similar-ish tech with infinity fabric\n\nDPU/NPU/IPU/xPU these are processors other than GPU or CPU and they’re typically mounted on a NIC. NVIDIA calls theirs Bluefield and it’s been kind of vaporware in the industry so far. BF3 looks real and they’ll force it on you with their SpectrumX Ethernet product line. Net-net these products are about offloading functions from other more expensive compute. Everybody has one, but NVIDIA has the full ecosystem. \n\nEthernet is an open standard for networking and is the most broadly deployed networking tech in the world. Everybody makes this (Broadcom, Juniper, Cisco, NVIDIA, etc). The big problem for Ethernet isn’t bandwidth it’s latency because it’s an old. Which is why InfiniBand is so dominant in HPC. Many big players have formed the Ultra Ethernet Coalition to flatten the Ethernet stack and reduce latency making it more competitive with IB. NVIDIA is not part of the UEC but they could join in the future. NVIDIA does not have a moat in Ethernet. \n\nBroadcom and AMD are working to enable Infinity Fabric over PCIe when PCIe gen 7 launches in 12-18 months.
