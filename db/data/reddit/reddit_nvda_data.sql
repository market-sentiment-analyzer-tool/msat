Around the 29 minute mark, they talk about scaling limitations and \"why not just go an order of magnitude bigger right away?\".\n\nDemis explains that there are practical limits you run into at that level, such as how much compute can you fit in one datacenter, \"interesting distributed computing challenges\".  \"We have our TPUs that we\'re building on and designing all the time, **as well as using GPUs**\". Why would they ever use GPUs if their TPUs were definitively better? I actually have no certain answer here so would welcome insight, but the fact they still use GPUs says a lot.\n\n\nIt really isn\'t as simple as $/compute, because when compute goes 10x-100x, the costs (and capabilities) don\'t trend smoothly (read: there are many more challenges than just making performant silicon)\n\n\nSo, the apple rumors are definitely good for Google, but I wouldn\'t read through that they are bad for others.

This is a great, well-timed comparison of the how the AI infrastructure industry is forming and attempting to re shape itself.   Making sense of the CEO Speak.\n\nIn high tech, you’re either the best performance or the lowest cost.  Guys in the middle are “tweeners” or in between, offering neither the best performance nor the lowest cost and they typically don’t last too long.  Broadcom is definitely going for the value sell here.\n\nNvidia OTOH is building a Formula1 car for the F1 race, custom everything, but it\'s expensive.  I see Nvidia’s approach of the problem as holistic, they take apart and analyze every switch and every cycle to wring the best performance out of the entire solution, much like optimizing game performance.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) is coming to the party with a handful of assets:  Networking, custom silicon capabilities, software, compute, memory interfaces, system architecture, and an argument that the AI market is too expensive.  Their bone fides are that they are the partner building Google’s TPU.  Their compelling pitch, imho, is they are offering interchangeability, plug and play with different off the shelf parts to build your AI supercomputer.\n\nAVGO’s pitch is hey!, we’re pretty good at this.  We have all this experience and assets and we can help you (GOOG, META, MSFT) with your custom parts.  You don’t need to beat Nvidia, you just need ***good enough***.\n\nThe **tl;dr is Nvidia is best and costs like it.   But for “anyone who was betting that Nvidia would become a large market share donor in AI in the coming years, this isn’t going to happen anytime soon. “**\n\nAVGO seems to want to convince customers that lower performance solutions are perfectly acceptable.    For example PCI vs NVLink (which is 5x faster) for chip to chip communications, saying effectively commercial off the shelf solutions (COTS) are good enough for leading AI workloads.\n\nJensen’s strategy is keep raising the bar, run faster, out innovate everyone.   This seems a reasonable strategy if everyone is chasing larger LLMs on the way to AGI.\n\nWhat the other camp is trying to convince the world of is that the algorithms are basically already quantified, that it’s just a matter of tying these parts together in an economical way, and we have all the experience and expertise needed.  They are betting that the big strides in development are in the past, all there is to know, and if not, spend your money with us anyway, and we can learn together.   It’s like saying you don’t need a Formula1 car to compete in a Formula1 race, this Porsche street car is fine!\n\nThe admissions in weakness to this strategy, made by AVGO execs from whom the author snipped quotes, was a bit surprising to me:\n\n* “general processors are actually too powerful” - never heard that before!\n* He makes this point several times: “when you customize it, you can actually significantly cut the size and power.” - to which I respond, it’s just physics.  Cut the size and power and you cut performance too.\n* “the different aspects of an XPU. Number one, compute. We have developed a flow to optimize the architectural construction of that compute. **We have several software engineers in my team**, all they do is optimize the flow to build those accelerators” — This is almost hilarious.  Nvidia has entire departments dedicating to optimizing, not “several guys.”\n* He actually admits PCI is not that great for chip to chip communication and rolls out a bandaid:  “We built a native capability for optics so that you don\'t need to have a DSP or a retimer”\n\nThis is just a weird take from AVGO in my view.  They aren\'t communicating like the understand the AI problem and solutions, but instead, think cost will become the overriding factor.   Maybe he\'s right?  We\'ll see.   But I don\'t see how this serves them well as workloads continue to ratchet up in number of parameters.   The tide will obviously shift when Nvidia caves and has to pivot on pricing.

I’m not going to go full deep dive since I’m banging this out on my phone but at a high level the big networking technologies relevant to NVIDIA are:\n\nInfiniBand: nobody else has IB and no one will. They bought Mellanox a few years ago and own the full stack. This is the standard for high performance interconnect for HPC/AI cluster type workloads where low latency is key (Google MPI for bonus reading). There are some alternatives that will never be mainstream OmniPath from Cornelis Networks (formerly Intel) and Slingshot from HPE which is on gen 2 with gen 3 dev way behind schedule. \n\nNVLink which is their chip to chip or GPU to GPU fabric. This exists because PCIe is relatively slow. DGX uses this and you’ll see it listed as SXM and then a generation. Basically 8 GPUs are soldered onto the same PCB. AMD is a ways behind but is going to have similar-ish tech with infinity fabric\n\nDPU/NPU/IPU/xPU these are processors other than GPU or CPU and they’re typically mounted on a NIC. NVIDIA calls theirs Bluefield and it’s been kind of vaporware in the industry so far. BF3 looks real and they’ll force it on you with their SpectrumX Ethernet product line. Net-net these products are about offloading functions from other more expensive compute. Everybody has one, but NVIDIA has the full ecosystem. \n\nEthernet is an open standard for networking and is the most broadly deployed networking tech in the world. Everybody makes this (Broadcom, Juniper, Cisco, NVIDIA, etc). The big problem for Ethernet isn’t bandwidth it’s latency because it’s an old. Which is why InfiniBand is so dominant in HPC. Many big players have formed the Ultra Ethernet Coalition to flatten the Ethernet stack and reduce latency making it more competitive with IB. NVIDIA is not part of the UEC but they could join in the future.

Morgan Stanley**\n\nOther shorter term comments include:\n\n* HBM 3e supply is not a concern, even as we are constrained near term. The company remains highly confident that they will qualify their 3rd HBM3e supplier (Samsung, covered by Shawn Kim), and with or without that incremental supply the company sees an HBM3e ramp that will not be a bottleneck after the first couple of quarters. HBM3e will commoditize somewhat with more suppliers and a lack of shortage.\n\n* Air cooled racks - NVL36 - will be shipping in volume as a large portion of January quarter revenues. Liquid cooled progress is good, with all the building blocks coming together, but it\'s a major transition that takes a bit longer. Longer term liquid cooled NVL72 is expected to be the main workhorse of the blackwell lineup.\n* While our Asia team has heard of roadmap adjustments to products that were never officially announced, such as B200A or NVL36x2, we were told there are no major changes to the roadmap; our sense is that any tweaks are simply designed to optimize around the products that customers want most. Confirmed the name change from Blackwell Ultra to GB300, but that\'s strictly a name change with no implications for the roadmap.\n\n* Foundry sourcing remains heavily focused on TSMC, covered by Charlie Chan, with less Samsung dependence and Intel projects small and a couple of years away.\n\n* Gross margins, per CFO commentary, are as described, with modest pressure this quarter and next around the ramp of newer lower yield products; we model next year\'s gross margins at the same level that we exit this year, but we maintain the belief that this may prove conservative.\n\n* Management does not know if there will be incremental export controls on the China-based H20, but it does not seem to be a major concern. The choice to ramp H20 at lower price points when there is plenty of Hopper demand elsewhere was negative for margins, but NVIDIA wants to serve demand in all regions. If they are forced to move Hopper supply to higher price points it does not appear to be a meaningful earnings variance.\n\nThoughts on the stock: The stock has been very robust of late, and we are almost back to the all time highs. We have seen sentiment swing back to the positive levels as well, as the very strong supply chain commentary is being matched with obvious hyperscaler demand, and our incoming call volume on NVIDIA (at least up until this NDR) had dropped, which tends to indicate complacent and positive views.\n\nWe remain very bullish longer term, but would concede given the rally that shorter term upside from here raises the bar on earnings somewhat. Our enthusiasm for the stock remains highest when there are short term debates that can be quickly resolved, such as the gross margin pressures around the quarter, lead time issues, or product ramp issues. When consensus shifts to very high CY25 expectations - where we are right now - the debate tends to shift to CY26 and beyond. While we are optimistic on longer term prospects, those debates are harder to resolve.\n\nThe company has very clearly been coming in $2 bn ahead of their guidance each quarter, with gross margins 1 point or more above guidance, with regularity, and that has become the expectation. (The one exception on gross margin was last quarter, where gross margins were only slightly higher than guidance, which caused some consternation - but a large number of Blackwell rev 0 wafers were scrapped, which seems a one time event). At some point, the magnitude of upside is likely to climb, and there are some indications that this could be a quarter with more upside, but we would expect very conservative revenue treatment, and are not ready to drive up expectations just yet. So we would keep our near term expectations for more of the same, rather than a breakout to a new level.\n\nAll those caveats having been said, this is still an exceptional situation, with AI the most important trend in technology, and NVIDIA unquestionably the biggest beneficiary of those investments; we would be careful about applying commodity cyclical frameworks when the pace of investment continues to elevate.\n\n**As a result, NVIDIA remains our top pick in semis, Overweight rated, with a $150 target.**'),(576,'NVDA_Stock','1g0okso','lra8vdn','2024-10-10',9,0.9994,'**PART 1.  Morgan Stanley**\n\nThis week we hosted Nvidia CEO for a 3 day non deal road show. Long term confidence remains high, with management highlighting new opportunities derived from the complexity of inference scaling exponentially with \"long thinking\".\n\nKey takeaways\n\n* Every indication from management is that we are still early in a long term AI investment cycle\n\n* Newest element is the much more complex inference coming from \"long thinking\", inference interactions requiring substantially more computation\n\n* Blackwell systems NVL36/72 remains the best solution for those challenges, providing systems level differentiation vs. merchant and custom alternatives.\n\n* **Shorter term, Blackwell ramp progressing on schedule with that product sold out next 12 months, pointing to continued strong conditions**\n\n* Remain OW, remains our Top Pick in semis\n\nThis week we hosted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress and other members of the management team for a three day NDR in New York City. It\'s no surprise that management enthusiasm remains high both short term and long term, with the strong sense that there is still material growth ahead. Perhaps the newest element of the story is the view that inference is starting to solve much more complex problems which will require a much richer mix of hardware - with NVIDIA\'s upcoming rack scale products as an optimal solution. The longer term vision is that deep thinking will allow every company in the world to hire large numbers of \"digital AI employees\" that can execute challenging tasks.\n\nThe high cost of scaling training clusters has been an element of the positive trends in the last 12 months, and the explosive adoption of higher end GPUs in Gen AI inference has also been a positive. But the notion that a more thoughtful, task oriented inference would cause an exponential jump in inference complexity strikes us an important new avenue for growth, and another clear area where NVIDIA\'s full stack approach to solving these problems adds to the company\'s considerable lead.\n\nWe share some detail on those evolutions below, but the clear view continues to be that we are set up for an exceptionally strong 2025 that management characterizes as an early stage of a long term investment cycle - Jensen did make it clear that he expects growth again in 2026, though he did not quantify.\n\nCould inference compute scale exponentially with \"long thinking\"? Throughout our meetings Jensen frequently referenced the recently released o1 model (also known as strawberry) from open-ai, which can produce a chain of thought before responding to queries. Unencumbering model output from latency constraints and enabling the model to \"think\" as long as it needs to before responding. Per Open-AI: \"We have found that the performance of o1 consistently improves with more reinforcement learning (train-time compute) and with more time spent thinking (test-time compute)\". Open-AI has never been explicit about the cost differential from o1 inference, but some sources suggest it could be somewhere in the 10x range vs GPT-4. And more importantly for the Nvidia growth story as exciting as the capabilities on the o1 preview are the model is simply too slow and too expensive for developers to see it as a viable option for building a consumer facing applications that have any kind of latency concern (with the caveat that OAI has smaller o1-mini model which is more competitive).\n\nThe bigger picture is the Nvidia team is excited about what a model trained on a Blackwell or Rubin system will be able to enable two three or four generations from now. With o1 a GPT-4 class model (GPT-4 was trained in 2022 on A100s) the advances we\'ve made in hardware over the last few years haven\'t really shown up in their entirety yet. And for inference we can only speculate as to the incremental compute will it take to serve a GPT-6 class model with these advanced capabilities at low latency. But it seems likely that its going to be an order of magnitude more compute intensive than what we consider leading edge today. And Nvidia is not talking specifically about open-ai, the o1 model just serves as an example of where the company thinks LLMs are headed and the new inference scaling law they see as a huge boon to the business over time.\n\nWhat does a more thoughtful inference enable? The NVIDIA long term vision articulated here is that all enterprises ten years from now will have thousands of \"digital employees\" doing very difficult tasks - programmers, circuit designers, marketing program managers, paralegals, etc. will be treated like humans. Businesses will be run with humans talking to AIs, AIs talking to AIs, humans talking to humans.\n\nScaling up this agent intelligence requires both more sophisticated training, but also increasingly more sophisticated inference. Inference comes more than conversational transactions, more about doing highly complex tasks that can require multiple attempts.\n\nEven workloads that seemed solved a few years ago will now require much more complicated compute with these approaches. Computer vision was considered to be \"computationally solved\" a few years ago, but the ability to take that image recognition and apply human or superhuman thought/interpretation still eludes us. In Jensen\'s words, computer vision has been solved for the fruit fly brain as image recognition improves, but to get to the understanding human brains we still have a long way to go. That is even more the case when it comes to the most complex multimodal generational AI tasks.\n\nAll of this drives much more complex inference which implies significantly higher investment requirements into inference hardware.\n\nNVIDIA is positioning Blackwell - in particular the rack scale systems - as breakthrough technology for solving these problems. Blackwell brings a much more capable processor to the AI markets, but the most important innovation could come from the GB200 systems incorporating a \"full rack\" approach. By introducing the Grace CPU into the system, as well as a much higher complexity NVLink chip to chip connectivity, the company is enabling 36 or 72 GPU racks that have each GPU talking to all of the other GPUs at the same time, putting all of the GPUs in the same NVLink domain and dramatically enhancing the ability to treat the entire rack as a massive GPU.\n\nOf course, all of that has been known since GTC in March, but the company insists that other solutions that lack this system integration capability - including all merchant competitors and most custom silicon competitors other than Google\'s TPU - will struggle to meet the new requirements of these new models.\n\nOur view continues to be that NVIDIA is likely to actually gain share of AI processors in 2025, as the biggest users of custom silicon are seeing very steep ramps with NVIDIA solutions next year. Everything that we heard this week reinforced that.\n\nIn the shorter term, the Blackwell ramp appears to be quite strong, with no major changes to the roadmaps and every indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility, in line with all of our checks. Issues with initial Blackwell silicon are now totally behind us. Management did give some color on the initial ramp issues with Blackwell; the first version of silicon was functional, but had very low yields; importantly, the yield problems were mostly discovered post packaging, which meant that scrapped product would require a loss of CoWoS and HBM3e, both overall supply constraints at the moment. But those issues are behind the company and there is high conviction in prior guidance that they will have several billion in Blackwell revenue in the January quarter.\n\nAny new Blackwell orders now that aren\'t already in queue will be shipped late next year, as they are booked out 12 months or so, which continues to drive strong short term demand for Hopper which will still be a major factor though the year. While there was no new short term revenue or margin commentary, this view obviously portends continued high growth in shipment trends through the year.'),(577,'NVDA_Stock','1g0okso','lrb7s7j','2024-10-10',3,0.807,'Great thanks for posting!'),(578,'NVDA_Stock','1g0okso','lrbfj1r','2024-10-10',2,0.2732,'This is the kinda content I thrive for in this sub.

GPT4 to GPT6 will be orders of magnitude. More GPUs.\n\n4. More and more complex applications. We saw this in, what was it called, Computex? Weather simulations, physics, biochemistry, genetics, proteins, pharmaceuticals. They just had an article the other day about simulating semiconductor photolitho mask designs. Insanity.

The racks (the new massive chip, call it Silicon-in-Rack), the connections, the cooling, the design of the chips, the software, etc. itâ€™s easy to see where they are headed: an entire data center of entirely interconnected GPUs. One massive GPU consisting of thousands or even millions of Blackwell equivalent chips.\n\nBottom line is this AI boom is just starting and it will never end.

CNBC will be on the ground. Based on the speaking agenda and announcements leading up to the conference, AI tools to conquer administrative burdens will be the star of this yearâ€™s show. \n\nDoctors and nurses are responsible for mountains of documentation as they work to keep up with patient records, interface with insurance companies and comply with regulators. Often, these tasks are painstakingly manual, in part because health data is siloed and stored across multiple vendors and formats. \n\nThe daunting administrative workload is a major cause of burnout in the industry, and itâ€™s part of the reason a nationwide shortage of 100,000 health-care workers is expected by 2028, according to consulting firm Mercer. Tech companies, eager to carve out a piece of a market that could top $6.8 trillion in spending by the decadeâ€™s end, argue that their generative AI tools can help.\n\nGoogle, for instance, said itâ€™s working to expand its health-care customer base by tackling administrative burden with AI.\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced the general availability of Vertex AI Search for Healthcare, which it introduced in a trial capacity during HLTH last year. Vertex AI Search for Healthcare allows developers to build tools to help doctors quickly search for information across disparate medical records, Google said. New features within Googleâ€™s Healthcare Data Engine, which helps organizations build the platforms they need to support generative AI, are also now available, the company said.\n\nGoogle on Thursday released the results of a survey that said clinicians spend nearly 28 hours a week on administrative tasks. In the survey, 80% of providers said this clerical work takes away from their time with patients, and 91% said they feel positive about using AI to streamline these tasks. \n\nSimilarly, Microsoft on Oct. 11 announced its collection of tools that aim to lessen cliniciansâ€™ administrative workload, including medical imaging models, a health-care agent service and an automated documentation solution for nurses, most of which are still in the early stages of development. \n\nMicrosoft already offers an automated documentation tool for doctors through its subsidiary, Nuance Communications, which it acquired in a $16 billion deal in 2021. The tool, called DAX Copilot, uses AI to transcribe doctorsâ€™ visits with patients and turn them into clinical notes and summaries. Ideally, this means doctors donâ€™t have to spend time typing out these notes themselves. \n\nNurses and doctors complete different types of documentation during their shifts, so Microsoft said itâ€™s building a separate tool for nurses thatâ€™s best suited to their workflows. \n\nAI scribe tools such as DAX Copilot have exploded in popularity this year, and Nuanceâ€™s competitors, such as Abridge, which has reportedly raised more than $460 million, and Suki, which has raised $165 million, will also be at the HLTH conference. \n\nDr. Shiv Rao, the founder and CEO of Abridge, told CNBC in March that the rate at which the health-care industry has adopted this new form of clinical documentation feels â€œhistoric.â€ Abridge received a coveted investment from Nvidiaâ€™s venture capital arm that same month. \n\nNvidia is also gearing up to address doctor and nurse workloads at HLTH. \n\nKimberly Powell, the companyâ€™s vice president of health care, is delivering a keynote Monday that will explain how using generative AI will help health-care professionals â€œdedicate more time to patient care,â€ according to the conferenceâ€™s website.\n\nNvidiaâ€™s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are used to create and deploy the models that power OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT and similar applications. As a result, Nvidia has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the AI boom. Nvidia shares are up more than 150% year to date, and the stock tripled last year. \n\nThe company has been making steady inroads into the health-care sector in recent years, and it offers a range of AI tools across medical devices, drug discovery, genomics and medical imaging. Nvidia also announced expanded partnerships with companies such as Johnson & Johnson\n and GE HealthCare\n in March. \n\nWhile the health-care sector has historically been slow to adopt new technology, the buzz around administrative AI tools has been undeniable since ChatGPT exploded onto the scene two years ago. \n\nEven so, many health systems are still in the early stages of evaluating tools and vendors, and theyâ€™ll be making the rounds on the HLTH exhibition floor. Tech companies will have to prove they have the chops to tackle one of health careâ€™s most complex problems.'),(846,'NVDA_Stock','1g7he9f','lsqxqbh','2024-10-19',6,-0.4939,'Has anyone told you that Nvidia chips have insane demand, today?'),(847,'NVDA_Stock','1g7he9f','lsqzoot','2024-10-19',2,0,'Is this a press release?'),(848,'NVDA_Stock','1g80f04','lsusv5o','2024-10-20',1,0.545,'Usually this fall under Rule 3: No open ended personal advice threads and Rule 7: No Low Quality Content, but its content is just barely over the low quality standard, so I\'ll allow it for this time.  \n\nFuture ones better be higher quality, either by justifying via new revenue streams, mathematical FCF models etc or it will be removed and warning issued for no substantiation.'),(849,'NVDA_Stock','1g80f04','lsus6oj','2024-10-20',19,0.982,'That old thread was really interesting - thanks for sharing!

These replicants are designed to perform tasks that humans either cannot or do not want to do, such as dangerous labor in off-world colonies. Replicants are virtually indistinguishable from humans but are given limited lifespans (typically four years).\n	â€¢	Blade Runners: The story follows Rick Deckard, a â€œblade runner,â€ who is part of a special police unit tasked with hunting down and â€œretiringâ€ (a euphemism for killing) replicants who escape to Earth, as they are banned from the planet due to fears of rebellion or violence.\n	â€¢	Themes of Identity and Humanity: The film explores profound philosophical themes related to the nature of humanity, consciousness, and the ethics of creating life. Replicants are portrayed as struggling with their predetermined lifespans and often exhibit more humanity and emotional depth than their human counterparts, raising questions about what it truly means to be human.\n\nDystopian Elements:\n\n	â€¢	Environmental Decline: The world of Blade Runner is depicted as grim and polluted, with constant rain, poor air quality, and minimal natural elements. The Earth is shown to be a declining planet, with many humans migrating to off-world colonies.\n	â€¢	Class Divide: There is a stark contrast between the wealthy, powerful elite (such as Tyrell) who live in high towers above the city and the struggling masses in the overpopulated, dilapidated streets below.\n	â€¢	Technological Overload: Society is dominated by large corporations and filled with towering, neon advertisements, showcasing how commercialism and technological advancements have saturated daily life.\n\nBlade Runner is now regarded as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time for its exploration of these themes, its striking visual style, and its lasting impact on the genre.'),(854,'NVDA_Stock','1g80f04','lsvikxx','2024-10-20',6,-0.1877,'As Jensen stated, billion dollar industries that have not even been created yet will be born.'),(855,'NVDA_Stock','1g80f04','lswokzk','2024-10-20',4,0.9201,'Let\'s check this against fundamentals and \"reasonable\" assumptions.  \n  \nWorldwide GDP is over 100T.

For Nvidia, those three areas â€œmove the needle most profoundly,â€ he said. â€œWhen itâ€™s our most impactful work, itâ€™s easiest to get energy around it.â€\n\nHuang was interviewed onstage by Daryl Plummer, a distinguished vice president, chief of research and fellow at Gartner.\n\nIn the long term, Nvidia is creating what Huang calls its own â€œAI brain.â€ Thatâ€™s the idea that knowledge of how a company works, its business processes and customer interactions need to be collected and turned over to AI. The end goal is to turn that information into an AI that CIOs and CEOs â€œcan just talk to,â€ Huang said.\n\nNvidia has already started turning all of its private data into an AI, Huang said, adding that â€œeverybody should do that.â€\n\nIn service of that goal, the company is announcing a tool that makes PDF files easier for AI to understand and ingest, Huang said. For the most part, â€œunstructured dataâ€ like emails and PDFs have been difficult for more traditional types of AI to capture.\n\nFurther down the line, it also means companies will have â€œlarge populations of digital workers,â€ or AI agents, working alongside their human counterparts, Huang said. To get there, everyoneâ€”including business technology leadersâ€”needs to learn how to instruct an AI.\n\nâ€œYouâ€™re still going to be doing programming,â€ he said. â€œBut you will be programming some kind of a structured way of communicating with AIs.â€'),(955,'NVDA_Stock','1g9oj7r','lt7o24o','2024-10-22',6,0.8057,'Iâ€™ve been banging the AI drum at my company for two years.

Their ability is going to depend on how much product can be produced and shipped out, as big tech isn\'t able to get as many chips as they need, and the 12 month backlog will increase exponentially before Rubin hits the ground.\n\nAs far as chips, I may be unaware of chip models Microsoft and others make besides ASICs chips, but if you\'re referring to ASICs, they\'re incapable of processing in the manner that a GPU does.\n\nWith all of that said, I also don\'t think this coming earnings is going to be very big, and from what Beth Kindig (y\'all can hate me for mentioning an analyst, but she\'s quite straightforward) is saying, bigger production numbers may not show until Q2 and Q3.

Stop and think about that for a moment. The blackwell GPU is running HOT. It\'s a GPU for Christmas sakes. Of course it runs hot. It\'s supposed to run hot.\n\nThis is perhaps pedantic but Blackwell and other such chips are **not** GPUs. They perform no graphics functions. They do not have display outputs. These are AI/ML accelerators. I know NVIDIA likes to stick with the \"GPU\" term but it\'s very much a misnomer at this point.\n\nMoving to the issue of heat. GPUs, CPUs, embedded FPGAs, ASICs, all chips are designed with particular power targets and cooling systems in mind.  No chip is \"supposed to run hot\". Not in your datacenter, not in your laptop. They are supposed to operate *within the parameters they were designed for* and if they don\'t bad things happen. If you\'re lucky they throttle performance. If you\'re not lucky they burn.\n\nWith every generation NVIDIA pushes power limits and prices. The old V100 was designed for 300 watts, the A100 lifted it to 400 watts, the H100 went to 700 watts, and Blackwell is [1,000 ](https://navitassemi.com/nvidias-grace-hopper-runs-at-700-w-blackwell-will-be-1-kw-how-is-the-power-supply-industry-enabling-data-centers-to-run-these-advanced-ai-processors/)to [1,200 watts](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/18/nvidia_turns_up_the_ai/). And there are eight of these in a chassis pulling almost 10kW before you even get to the CPU/RAM/NICS/etc.\n\nThis causes serious headaches for server builders/integrators as your entire power distribution system has to change, your cooling system has to change, now you\'re even required to go with liquid cooling. This means there are data centers where certain SKUs cannot even be installed.\n\nIf you had a server design to cope with 1000 watts per socket and NVIDIA decides it\'s now 1200 in the final release version of the chip then you\'ve got problems.\n\n>Do you think you could increase supply with the new Arizona plant when it is opened and by how much?Â \n\n50,000 wafers per month from two fabs with NVIDIA getting maybe around 15-20% of that. Maybe an increase in supply of around 25% but that\'s very rough guestimates based on TSMC\'s total being around 150-200k/month wafer throughput on 4nm.\n\n>Where do you see robotics and edge jetson / orion local GPU\'s increasing adoption..How about the Nvidia drive system\n\nI think they didn\'t ask about that because it doesn\'t matter. It\'s not part of the NVIDIA growth story. Margins are low. And it\'s only around 2% of revenue.  The largest traditional automakers in the world don\'t use them. The largest EV makers use their own in-house designed chips. So it\'s not really something which has an impact on stock price.\n\n>What about the extra manufacturing time you took away from another supplier (AMD)Â \n\nYou might be talking about the Morgan Stanley note which said \"AMD appears to have trimmed some CoWoS wafer booking at TSMC for 2025 which was taken by NVIDIA\".  I wouldn\'t read too much into that. It\'s third hand and there\'s no key detail.

Several years is my guess)\n\nJensen Hwang has been saying there is interest from other governments to build their own AI models and cloud infrastructure rather than only relying on AWS, google, and Microsoft, and if that is true it will also drive demand for Nvidia chips, though I doubt to the same extent. \n\nBut even if we hit the Bust stage, where demand is lower than before, I don\'t see Nvidia going back to where they were before Chatgpt launched, where majority of their revenue is from gaming.

Beyond the silicon, the CUDA software stack doesn\'t (yet) have any comparable alternatives. Some are in the works, but the mindshare around CUDA is going to force alternatives to emulate the CUDA interfaces, which gives NVIDIA a lot of steering power over the broader software development landscape.\n\nAlso, NVIDIA\'s commitment earlier this year to open source development of their drivers in the Linux Kernel is a commitment to the Linux kernel and kernel development processes that will enable them to drive value up the software stack for years to come. \n\nA big part of the valuation picture revolves around NVIDIA\'s ability to manage their position in the broader technology ecosystem. There\'s plenty of room for them to grow and the demand for GPUs is only going to continue as e.g. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all scramble to light-up nuclear power plants to fuel AI\'s massive energy demands.

As you note, there is no robotaxi at the moment.

Today, it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by up to thousands of computing cores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself, enables computers to learn from data and serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world.

Instead, they serve different purposes:\n\n- GPUs are ideal for deep learning tasks, like neural network training and inference.\n- QPUs are better suited for solving complex optimization problems, simulating complex systems, and potentially speeding up certain machine learning algorithms.\n\nIn the future, we may see hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both GPUs and QPUs. For example, a GPU could be used for deep learning tasks, while a QPU is used to speed up certain components of the algorithm.\n\n# Summary\nIn summary, GPUs and QPUs are both powerful tools for AI applications, but they serve different purposes and have different strengths and weaknesses.

The firm\'s optimism is based on NVIDIA\'s continued dominance in artificial intelligence (AI) and the potential launch of a client-side central processing unit (CPU) in 2025.**\n\nAccording to InvestingPro data, NVIDIA maintains a perfect Piotroski Score of 9, indicating exceptional financial strength, while analyst targets range from $130 to $220.\n\nNVIDIA has experienced significant success as an investment over the past two years, largely driven by surging demand in AI technology. The company\'s impressive 152.44% revenue growth and 75.86% gross profit margins demonstrate this momentum.\n\nTruist Securities anticipates that calendar year 2025 will prove to be another positive year for the company. This forecast is supported by industry contacts who affirm NVIDIA\'s comprehensive technology stack, which includes not only hardware components like chips and server racks but also software and pre-trained models, as superior in the field.\n\nThe analyst from Truist Securities highlighted the company\'s potential expansion into the CPU market. With expectations that NVIDIA will unveil a client-side CPU during 2025, the firm sees an opportunity for NVIDIA to tap into an additional total addressable market (TAM) of approximately $35 billion. This expansion potential comes as NVIDIA maintains strong financial health, with InvestingPro analysis showing the company\'s overall financial health score as GREAT.\n\nThe price target adjustment reflects the confidence in NVIDIA\'s strategic positioning within the AI industry and its ability to innovate and capture new market segments. NVIDIA\'s full-stack approach, combining hardware and software capabilities, is particularly noted as a key factor in maintaining its industry leadership.\n\nThe Truist Securities analyst\'s statement underscores the belief in NVIDIA\'s capacity to continue its growth trajectory and to successfully introduce new products that will further solidify its market position. The anticipated client CPU release is set to broaden NVIDIA\'s reach and potentially enhance its financial performance in the coming years.'),(2939,'NVDA_Stock','1hfo5tc','m2cul3v','2024-12-16',23,0,'But price dropping?'),(2940,'NVDA_Stock','1hfo5tc','m2d5vbq','2024-12-16',4,0.8651,'Here we go again the analyst never stop guessing.

While downplaying temporary transitional problems, the financial company emphasized significant demand for Nvidia\'s future Blackwell GPU as the main driver of its hopeful attitude.\n\nUnder the direction of Joseph Moore, the study noted present issues as transient and recommended that the market acceptance of Nvidia\'s Blackwell GPUs would determine its long-term viability. Driven by their revenue-generating potential, Moore anticipated that these GPUs will rule conversations by the second part of 2025.\n\nTrendforce\'s data points to this view: sales predicted to peak in the second and third quarters and Blackwell GPU manufacture expected to rise in early 2025. This path fits Morgan Stanley\'s projections of a 44.1% revenue increase for Nvidia in 2025, which would surpass rivals like Broadcom (AVGO, Financials) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financials).\n\nWith CEO Jensen Huang coming to give a keynote presentation, Nvidia\'s attendance at the Consumer Electronics Show in January is likely to support its position. Analysts believe that Nvidia will highlight the great demand for Blackwell GPUs using the event to show how these products would influence the market leadership of the firm.\n\nMorgan Stanley is still sure that supply restrictions would relax by mid-2025, which will let Nvidia fully profit from the expected Blackwell launch success and strengthen its competitive advantage in the GPU market.'),(3188,'NVDA_Stock','1hiradv','m31se2e','2024-12-20',4,0.34,'I certainly expect to hit 200 soon.'),(3189,'NVDA_Stock','1hiradv','m30x2uh','2024-12-20',9,0,'166$ in one year lol, thatâ€™s nothing'),(3190,'NVDA_Stock','1hiqimv','m30to3n','2024-12-20',17,0,'They aren\'t even close to being an actual competitor.Â '),(3191,'NVDA_Stock','1hiqimv','m30q5mz','2024-12-20',18,0.9041,'Must read for all the FOMO out there.\n\n  \n\"I provide data that shows the move in Broadcomâ€™s stock was premature, creating outsized pressure on Broadcom to live up to AI juggernaut Nvidia in 2025, which is unrealistic given Broadcom has only \\~25% of revenue from AI versus 80% of revenue from Nvidia.

The only way to tell the actual performance is to run benchmarking.\n\n\\- Nvidiaâ€™s Out of the Box Performance & Experience is amazing, and we did not run into any Nvidia specific bugs during our benchmarks. Nvidia tasked a single engineer to us for technical support, but we didnâ€™t run into any Nvidia software bugs as such we didnâ€™t need much support.\n\n\\- AMDâ€™s Out of the Box Experience is very difficult to work with and can require considerable patience and elbow grease to move towards a usable state. On most of our benchmarks, Public AMD stable releases of AMD PyTorch is still broken and we needed workarounds.\n\n\\- If we werenâ€™t supported by multiple teams of AMD engineers triaging and fixing bugs in AMD software that we ran into, AMDâ€™s results would have been much lower than Nvidiaâ€™s.\n\n\\- We ran unofficial MLPerf Training GPT-3 175B on 256 H100 in collaboration with Sustainable Metal Cloud to test the effects of different VBoost setting\n\n\\- For AMD, Real World Performance on public stable released software is nowhere close to its on paper marketed TFLOP/s. Nvidiaâ€™s real world performance also undershoots its marketing TFLOP/s, but not by nearly as much.\n\n\\- The MI300X has a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to the H100/H200, but training performance per TCO is higher on the MI300X on public stable releases of AMD software. This changes if one uses custom development builds of AMD software. \n\n\\- Training performance is weaker, as demonstrated by the MI300X â€˜s matrix multiplication micro-benchmarks, and AMD public release software on single-node training throughput still lags that of Nvidiaâ€™s H100 and H200.\n\n\\- MI300X performance is held back by AMD software. AMD MI300X software on BF16 development branches have better performance but has not yet merged into the main branch of AMDâ€™s internal repos. By the time it gets merged into the main branch and into the PyTorch stable release, Nvidia Blackwell will have already been available to everyone.\n\n\\- AMDâ€™s training performance is also held back as the MI300X does not deliver strong scale out performance. This is due to its weaker ROCm Compute Communication Library (RCCL) and AMDâ€™s lower degree of vertical integration with networking and switching hardware compared to Nvidiaâ€™s strong integration of its Nvidia Collective Communications Library (NCCL), InfiniBand/Spectrum-X network fabric and switches.\n\n\\- Many of AMD AI Libraries are forks of NVIDIA AI Libraries, leading to suboptimal outcomes and compatibility issues.\n\n\\- AMD customers tend to use hand crafted kernels only for inference, which means their performance outside of very narrow well defined use cases is poor, and their flexibility to rapidly shifting workloads is non-existent.'),(3203,'NVDA_Stock','1hk9txw','m3ctve1','2024-12-22',5,0.3818,'I guess it shows how far ahead team green really isâ€¦ imagine they keep pressing with innovation in this and other sectors over the coming yearsâ€¦'),(3204,'NVDA_Stock','1hk9txw','m3csc4w','2024-12-22',5,0.8689,'Great insight.

The B300 is another performance leap forward by factors. By unbundling hardware elements that are not core to NVDA, hyperscalers can acquire that margin for themselves.\n\nThe current model where everyone uses NVDA\'s reference architecture and components that included cooling, boards, etc, made sense in a world where AI compute purchases were smaller. When orders are many billions of dollars, customers have enough at stake to design custom hardware solutions to meet specific needs.\n\nNVDA is letting customers use their GPU, interconnect technology, and software, which is best in the world, and let hyperscalers handle everything else to fine tune their datacenters and save money. By letting customers shift resources towards optimizing datacenter buildout while letting NVDA handle the AI side, hyperscalers save money and have more flexibility. NVDA benefits with potentially higher margins.\n\nIf hyperscalers can optimize their datacenters and save costs with NVDA, they have less incentive to invest huge resources in duplicating what NVDA has already accomplished. Investing too much in internal GPUs/TPUs risks having an inferior solution to competitors who use NVDA and can offer lower cost and more flexible solutions.\n\nTLDR:  \n\\- Reduce non-core markups for hyperscalers using NVDA  \n\\- Better optimization / customization for hyperscalers  \n\\- Incentive to stick with NVDA  \n\\- Potentially higher margins for NVDA by focusing on highest margin components (GPU/interconnects)  \n\\- Makes developing custom chips riskier for hyperscalers'),(3312,'NVDA_Stock','1hlz24t','m3q5jy5','2024-12-25',2,0,'What does it say about margins?

But here\'s the street jist:\n\nBig-Gov says we have a stronger than expected \"market\" (jobs, blah blah) and decline in unemployment to something (whatever is \"historically low\"). This says our economy is growing healthy. \n\nMore jobs = more household income (does it really? I dunno, flipping more burgers might? who knows)\nThis increase does (somehow???) increase consumer spending on goods, services, and investments(terrible investments like 500 shoes, and overpriced cars, oh and some houses, perhaps hookers but that\'s only serviceable in 1-2 areas in the USA). \n\nStrong employment says there is an increase in demand for goods/services (yeah, i suppose i need that extra car wash every 2 weeks).\nBusinesses expand operations; hire more people (those 18 year olds definitely need that gig at walmart).\n\nSince the goody good data has come out, the market (well that\'s us, institutions, market makers, sonic the hedgehog, Goku, etc) expects a pause on rate cuts. Hell, there may even be a rate hike (Yikes!!!) because, well, that\'s the only way the FED thinks inflation can be controlled (how about every administration stop doing what every administration has done since the 70s...handing out free money for way too long and require that you must do MORE than the minimum to stop receiving this free money - unless of course you are disabled beyond the ability to hold a considerable job). \n\nTreasury -\nSome investors who are into bonds may adjust to the chances or likelyhood that rates go up in the future. \nSome selling pressure goes up, why? Well, because big daddy cool bucks with old person\'s money try to lock in current rates before yields rise. \n\nBut these yields go up because treasury issuers need to offer higher returns...why? Well, it attracts more buyers. Like enticing kids with candy (oh, wait, my bad...i know nothing of that).\n\nWell, low and behold, treasury yields rise. Due to the expectation of the FED rates and possible inflation, the 10-year goes up.\nHow this impacts cash-flow is basically high yields make treasuries more attractive over low-yield savings accounts or whatever dividend stock is the flavor of the week. Money then leaves equities and flows into treasuries much unlike oil flowing into water.  This increases demand for higher yields because the money(buyers) demand it. \n\nAnother thing is that mortgage rates are influenced by treasury yields. As that yield rises, mortgage rates rise. And this decreases the new income (funny how the government has devised a way to keep us all on this treadmill, but I like to look at it like a mouse wheel)\n\nThese moves scare people. You may see people investing in things like gold or real estate while moving away from stock assets. The higher yields cause stock prices to fall because of the so called risk free rate. So investors move into treasury instead of stocks. Like even mutual funds will reallocate cash into bonds to help their return for their customers grow. \n\nBasically, everyone moves their money in another direction so expectations of EVEN A NICE report on NVIDIA ends up not moving the needle much because, hey, we are all on the Treasury train until that train derails inevitably.\n\nI probably forgot some things or mistyped here or there but this is the jist...'),(3696,'stocks','1hvyqgw','m5x3cgc','2025-01-07',-5,0,'Overpriced'),(3697,'stocks','1hvyqgw','m5xjjk0','2025-01-07',0,-0.6261,'Everything is down.

But to play devils advocate for a momentâ€¦ we might not have to wait that long. AI is already showing it can turbocharge the process.\n\nFor one, AI is incredible at optimizing complex systems, and that includes quantum algorithms. Instead of painstakingly testing every possible approach, machine learning models can sift through massive parameter spaces and figure out the best solutions far faster than humans ever could. That could mean quantum computers become practical way sooner than anyone expects.\n\nThen thereâ€™s the hardware. Quantum machines are notoriously hard to build and even harder to maintain, thanks to issues like error rates and decoherence. But AI can simulate these systems, predict how materials will behave, and even help design better chip architectures. In a way, itâ€™s like having an extra layer of intelligence guiding engineers through the tricky process of creating scalable and reliable quantum hardware.\n\nMaterials are another huge bottleneck. Quantum computers rely on specialized substances like superconductors, which can take years to discover and test. AI, though, can model and predict material properties with incredible accuracy, helping researchers zero in on the most promising candidates. Itâ€™s like speeding through years of trial and error in a fraction of the time.\n\nAnd what about all those errors quantum computers are so prone to? AI can help create smarter error-correction techniques and real-time error mitigation strategies, it can make quantum systems much more stable. Even the simulations researchers run on classical computers to test quantum theories can get a boost from AI, making the entire research process faster and more efficient.\n\nAI can also help automate the discovery process itself. Instead of relying on researchers to manually analyze experiments and tweak setups, machine learning models can scan massive datasets, spot patterns, and suggest entirely new directions for exploration.\n\nThereâ€™s also the potential for hybrid quantum-classical systems, where AI plays a key role in bridging the gap. These setups could combine quantum processors with classical computing to handle problems more efficiently, even before we have fully error-free quantum systems. AI could also make quantum infrastructure more cost-effective by optimizing resources like cooling and power supplies, which are critical to keeping these machines running.\n\nSure, there are still a ton of challenges to overcome, and no oneâ€™s saying quantum computers will be everywhere tomorrow. Maybe it will take that long. But when you see how fast AI is evolvingâ€”and how much itâ€™s already accelerating quantum research, we might be closer than we think.'),(3903,'wallstreetbets','1hxvws7','m6cnfq7','2025-01-10',2,0,'Quantum 50% jump tomorrow'),(3904,'wallstreetbets','1hxvws7','m6cnjxc','2025-01-10',1,-0.4939,'Too late bro...the damage has been done to these stocks.

SoftBank and OpenAI are the lead partners for Stargate, with SoftBank having financial responsibility and OpenAI having operational responsibility. Masayoshi Son will be the chairman.\n\nArm, Microsoft, **NVIDIA**, Oracle, and OpenAI are the key initial technology partners. The buildout is currently underway, starting in Texas, and we are evaluating potential sites across the country for more campuses as we finalize definitive agreements.\n\nAs part of Stargate, Oracle, **NVIDIA**, and OpenAI will closely collaborate to build and operate this computing system. This builds on a deep collaboration between OpenAI and **NVIDIA** going back to 2016 and a newer partnership between OpenAI and Oracle.\n\nThis also builds on the existing OpenAI partnership with Microsoft. OpenAI will continue to increase its consumption of Azure as OpenAI continues its work with Microsoft with this additional compute to train leading models and deliver great products and services.\n\nAll of us look forward to continuing to build and develop AIâ€”and in particular AGIâ€”for the benefit of all of humanity.

AMD\'s GPU group will grow and even double in the next few years.   Is it enough to capture double digit market share?  I doubt it -- just look to how Nvidia has dominated GPU gaming for the indicator.  Their problem is underinvestment in software, a big issue is off-loading much of that to 3rd parties.\n\nNvidia on the other hand was building their software from scratch since the mid aughts.   They believe in taking their destiny in their own hands, not farming it out.   Not only do they have the most robust software, and therefore the most robust AI platform on the market, they continue to deeply invest and pivot into AI adjacent markets such as robotics, medical, materials science, pharma, digital biology, agriculture and self driving technology.  Beyond that, they have a fundamental believe in outrunning everyone in terms of bringing new/advanced product to market sooner than everyone else.  This is exactly how they dominated the PC graphics sector and it is exactly how they\'ve begun to dominate the AI sector.    But, but, but aren\'t Google and Microsoft and Amazon are building their own chips?   Yes they are.  But they have no clue who they\'re competing with and their chips are already years behind Nvidia\'s. \n\nSo it really depends on your outlook.

Despite market fears over competition from DeepSeek, analysts say the AI chip giant remains their top pick, with a price target of $152â€”implying a potential 22% upside. While DeepSeek\'s success with older A100 chips has raised concerns over long-term AI investment trends, Morgan Stanley sees no immediate threat. Demand for Nvidia\'s next-gen Blackwell and Hopper chips is holding strong, and CoreWeave\'s recent move to integrate Nvidia\'s GB200 NVL72 instances only reinforces confidence in the company\'s dominance.\n\nRegulatory risks? They\'re there. Morgan Stanley acknowledges that more U.S. export restrictions are likely, but they don\'t see them stopping Nvidia\'s momentum. The real question is whether alternative AI chip solutions can truly disrupt the space. Right now, the answer is no. ASICs might get some attention, but demand is expected to swing back in Nvidia\'s favor by the second half of the year. Meanwhile, major cloud players aren\'t scaling back their AI investmentsâ€”in fact, they\'re pressing forward. Nvidia\'s customers remain committed to long-term spending, a clear sign that the AI boom isn\'t slowing down anytime soon.\n\nWith earnings coming up on February 26, Morgan Stanley expects Nvidia to set the record straight. The firm sees demand visibility for Blackwell chips improving, setting up a strong 2024 for AI infrastructure spending.

U.S. officials in 2022 began restricting what the chip company could sell to China, which then accounted for a fifth of its sales.  \n\nTo keep up its business there, Chief Executive Jensen Huang turned to a lieutenant, Jonah Alben.  \n\nAlben told his boss there was no time to design a completely new chip for China. Instead, his answer was to take Nvidiaâ€™s top product at the time and reduce its performance to meet the U.S. rulesâ€”including by physically burning parts of the chip. Two months later, Nvidia began marketing the modified chip to Chinese customers.  \n\nAlben, 51, leads engineering of the worldâ€™s hottest product: computer chips for artificial intelligence. If Nvidia were KFC, he would be in charge of the chicken.  \n\nâ€œNvidia wouldnâ€™t be Nvidia without Jonah,â€ said Leo Tam, a former senior research scientist at the company. â€œHeâ€™s as important to the company as Jensen is.â€  \n\nThe job puts Alben at the center of the U.S.-China technology Cold Warâ€”with Chinese startups such as DeepSeek challenging industry leaders in the U.S. by using Nvidiaâ€™s made-for-China chips. U.S. officials grumble that the chips push the limit of export controls, undermining efforts to hobble Chinese AI advancement for military purposes. Nvidia says it follows the law.  \n\nAt the same time, Alben has to ensure that Nvidia keeps its overwhelming lead in AI chips for customers such as Alphabet and Microsoftâ€”the edge that raised Nvidiaâ€™s stock-market value above $3 trillion.\n\nThose who know Alben say his success comes from diving into the technical weeds, pushing the boundaries of rules and echoing the ultracompetitive nature of his boss of 28 years, the leather-jacket-wearing Huang.  \n\nNvidia declined to make Alben available for an interview.  \n\nOne of dozens of executives who report directly to Huang, Alben leads some 1,000 engineers as the companyâ€™s longtime head of engineering for graphics processing units. Even in a Nvidia office with some of the smartest Ph.D.s, what stands out to his former and current colleagues is the intellect of Alben, who stopped at a masterâ€™s degree. Also impressive, they say, is his ability to manage that collection of brains.  \n\nIt is a skill Alben credits to the years he spent sitting on the stern of a boat, a skinny fellow barking orders at eight men each double his size.  \n\nWhile attending Stanford in the 1990s, Alben did crew. In his role as coxswain, he led practices on a creek in nearby Redwood City and directed the rowers when to drive harder during races.    \n\nOne tactic pushed rowers to their limits, at least the first time he tried it.  \n\nâ€œJonah was known for calling the last 200 meters when there were 350 to go,â€ said former teammate Martin Schwartz.  \n\nRowing rules stated that coxswains weighing under 125 pounds had to make up the difference by carrying sandbags on the boat. But Alben, who tipped the scales at 117, didnâ€™t want to carry an ounce more than necessary.  \n\nSo on race mornings, say teammates, he chugged 8 pounds of waterâ€”about one gallon. Then he held it in until weigh-in and, before the regatta started, urinated it all out.  \n\nâ€œJonah did stand out to me as being somebody who was unusually capable of and willing to be carried onto the scale,â€ said former teammate Daniel Bergstresser, â€œin a state of almost popping.â€  \n\nAlben, who grew up in Schenectady, N.Y., took his Stanford experience to Nvidia in 1997. He made a quick impression. â€œIn 20 years I expect Iâ€™ll be working for Jonah,â€ Huang said at a staff meeting in Albenâ€™s early days, according to a recent book about the company by journalist Tae Kim.  \n\nSasha Ostojic, who a decade ago ran the team that designed software for Albenâ€™s hardware, said Alben was at his best when technical challenges arose.  \n\nOne time, when a graphics chip in development wasnâ€™t displaying movies properly, Alben met Ostojic and another co-worker to troubleshoot the issue.  \n\nâ€œJonah just comes in and says, â€˜Letâ€™s just look into the code line-by-line,â€™â€ Ostojic said. â€œJonah was driving the situation: What does this do? What does that do?â€  \n\nThe three eventually solved the problem without triggering the worst-case scenario: a hardware fix. â€œIf he makes a wrong move, he could set Nvidia back by six to 12 months,â€ Ostojic said.  \n\nThe attention to technical details is also prized by Huang, a former table-tennis prodigy who has attended conferences simply to learn. His theory is that company executives must immerse themselves in leading-edge research to understand where the market is going.  \n\nAlben agrees. Asked in a company podcast in 2020 how he would describe his job, he said: â€œYou try to figure out what the future should look like.â€  \n\nIt can take three years to develop Nvidiaâ€™s next cutting-edge chip. Alben said he made his best guess at what customers would want by speaking often with Nvidiaâ€™s in-house AI researchers.   \n\nNvidia chips were originally designed to generate graphics in videogames and other programs. Then, in the early 2010s, the company realized these kinds of chips were also ideal for training AI and solving new problemsâ€”which surprised even Alben.  \n\nHe said he remembered the moment when he realized the chips he was engineering had more potential than he ever imagined: He read a paper about a researcher using a graphics processing unit to simulate how the human nose smells.  \n\nâ€œThere was no salesperson from Nvidia that had ever called up that researcher to try to sell a GPU to him for that,â€ Alben said in the podcast. â€œThat has stuck with me as the first time I was like, OK, this isnâ€™t just for the three problems that were listed on our to-do list.â€  \n\nWrite to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com and Raffaele Huang at raffaele.huang@wsj.com'),(5193,'NVDA_Stock','1iqt85g','md318xk','2025-02-16',7,0,'How do you not go all in'),(5194,'NVDA_Stock','1iqt85g','md3932k','2025-02-16',1,0.9095,'Nice to know this about my favorite stock and biggest holding!

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of his key points, along with additional context.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Flawed Mental Model of AI Development\nHuang criticized the oversimplified belief that DeepSeekâ€™s cost-efficient training approach diminishes the need for high-performance hardware like Nvidiaâ€™s GPUs. He argued that this view ignores the **full lifecycle of AI development**, particularly the **post-training phase**, which is computationally intensive and vital for deploying high-quality AI systems.\n\n### What Investors Missed:\n- **Inference**: After training, models are deployed to make predictions or decisions in real-world applications. For example, generative AI systems like ChatGPT require massive inference infrastructure to serve millions of users simultaneously. This phase demands robust, high-performance hardware.\n- **Optimization and Fine-Tuning**: Post-training processes like reinforcement learning, domain-specific fine-tuning, and techniques such as quantization and pruning require significant compute power.\n- **Scalability**: Running AI systems at scaleâ€”whether for real-time applications or global deploymentsâ€”requires cutting-edge infrastructure, which Nvidia provides.\n\nHuang likened post-training to mentorship after formal educationâ€”essential for refining and specializing AI models for practical use.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Training Compute Demand Remains Critical\nWhile Huang emphasized post-training as a core driver of compute demand, itâ€™s important to note that **training compute needs are also growing exponentially**:\n- Large-scale foundation models (e.g., GPT-4 or beyond) require immense resources during their initial pre-training phase.\n- As models become more complex and data-hungry, the demand for high-performance GPUs during training continues to rise.\n\nDeepSeekâ€™s approach may have demonstrated cost savings for specific training scenarios, but it does not eliminate the need for Nvidiaâ€™s advanced GPUs in scaling state-of-the-art models.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Efficiency Drives New Compute Demand\nHuang highlighted a counterintuitive trend: **efficiency improvements in AI drive more demand for compute power**. Hereâ€™s why:\n- Lower costs make AI training and inference accessible to more industries and applications.\n- New use cases emerge as barriers to entry decrease, expanding adoption across sectors like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.\n- Saved resources are often redirected toward scaling larger models or exploring new tasks, creating a feedback loop of increasing compute demand.\n\nEfficiency doesnâ€™t reduce overall compute needsâ€”it enables broader adoption and innovation, reinforcing the importance of Nvidiaâ€™s hardware.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Nvidiaâ€™s Software Ecosystem: A Key Differentiator\nWhile much attention is given to Nvidiaâ€™s hardware (e.g., GPUs), its **software ecosystem** plays an equally critical role in maintaining its leadership:\n- **CUDA**: Nvidiaâ€™s proprietary parallel computing platform is widely adopted by developers for optimizing AI workloads.\n- **TensorRT**: A toolchain designed specifically for inference optimization.\n- **Nvidia AI Enterprise**: A suite of software tools that simplifies deployment across industries.\n\nThis integrated hardware-software approach creates a competitive moat that extends beyond raw hardware performance, ensuring Nvidia remains indispensable throughout the AI lifecycle.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Market Overreaction and Investor Sentiment\nHuang suggested that investors overreacted to DeepSeekâ€™s announcement by focusing narrowly on training costs while ignoring the larger picture:\n- The ongoing demand for high-performance compute in post-training, inference, and deployment phases remains strong.\n- Nvidiaâ€™s dominance in both hardware and software positions it as a critical player in scaling AI technologies globally.\n\nSince then, Nvidia\'s stock has recovered much of its losses as analysts reassessed the situation. Many now view the sell-off as a temporary reaction rather than a reflection of long-term fundamentals.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Broader Implications for the Industry\nDeepSeekâ€™s announcement raises broader questions about how efficiency improvements could reshape the industry:\n- Could cost-efficient approaches democratize access to AI or enable smaller players to compete?\n- Will alternative hardware providers (e.g., AMD, Intel, or custom ASICs) gain traction in specific niches?\n\nDespite these possibilities, Huang reaffirmed that Nvidia remains at the forefront of enabling cutting-edge AI development at scale.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\nJensen Huangâ€™s response underscores a crucial point: while innovations like DeepSeek may improve efficiency in certain aspects of AI development, they do not diminish the demand for high-performance computing across the full lifecycle of AIâ€”from training to post-training to inference. In fact, efficiency often drives new demand by enabling larger-scale adoption and innovation.\n\nNvidia\'s position as both a hardware and software leader ensures its relevance in this rapidly evolving landscape. Investors may have briefly misunderstood this dynamic, but Huangâ€™s vision reaffirms why Nvidia remains indispensable in powering the future of AI.'),(5479,'NVDA_Stock','1iukc84','mdz5x05','2025-02-21',7,-0.3375,'Nah, I saw there was panic selling, made a bag shorting, then bought the dip, my portfolio tells me I got it very right :D'),(5480,'NVDA_Stock','1iukc84','mdzvj6j','2025-02-21',2,0.8442,'Im feeling pretty confident Nvidia will be relatively stable for the next few months.

By comparison SP500 lost 53% of its values and took 6 years to recover.\n\nI agree that the future might be different but Nvidia is a speculative stock at this point. Nvidia sell server hardware at 10X the cost because they have a monopoly right now. That\'s also why their stock valuation is so high even after current correction.\n\nTo stay relevant against the competition they may have and will drop their price if necessary but that will eat their bottom line heavily.\n\nSure Nvidia was lucky to be invested in something that nobody really care because it was GPU for gamers but now doing a competitor is China first priority and their GPU are 1-2 generation behind, not far. Some startup, Mistral \"Le chat\" has partnered with a chip startup and their hardware allow that chatbot to be 10X faster than the competition. You get 1000 token/s vs 50-100.\n\nGoogle, Microsoft, Apple, Samsung, Amazon, openAI... They all invest heavily to build a competitor. They don\'t even need to be successful.

One is they\'re the engineers of the best products. They are an engineering organization first in that they identify and solve problems ... You know they\'re willing to listen to customers and help you solve problems and design things around new use cases.  But it\'s not just creating good hardware.  It\'s creating good hardware that scales and they can support it at scale and when you\'re building these installations that are hundreds of thousands of components on the accelerator side and the Infiniband link side, it all has to work together well.  \n\nWhen you go to somebody like Nvidia that has done this for so long at scale with such engineering expertise, they eliminate so much of that existential risk for these startups.  So when I look at it and see some of these smaller startups say we\'re going to go a different route, I\'m like what are you doing? You\'re taking so much risk for no reason here.  This is a proven solution, it\'s the best solution, and it has the most community support.

There are alternatives to Nvidia; AI, chip manufacturing, server making etc is not and will not ever be a one person takes all. Nvidia, at their current capacity, has no means of supplying finished products to all of their customers. Willingly taking a small hit to margins for the next 2 quarters illustrates this.\n\n\nEven after said 2 quarters, Nvidia will likely sell more chips due to being able to operate more efficiently and bringing margins back to normal as per Jensen\'s comments. However, they still won\'t service all of the demand for AI chips. Why? Because all of the chips being sold have their use cases. Tranium for instance has more ram which is good for running less demanding models. Doing something similar to deepseek where they ironed out bugs and really drove for efficiency on less powerful hardware. This allows companies using this tech like Amazon to make use of distillation (both old and newly devloped techniques) to justify buying inferior products now and getting started on projects right away. This results in making it a little easier to break even and turn a profit.\n\n\nBtw, if a customer backs out, it sure as hell matters which customer does and their allocation of gpus. Hyperscalers contribute a little over 50% of total AI hardware revenue for Nvidia (excluding networking). If one of them pulls out, wallstreet will wonder why. These hyperscalers plan to spend at least 60B each this year. If one of them drastically cuts their spending or scraps it altogether, Nvidia will nose dive regardless of what was said at GTC, in a conference call etc.\n\n\nMsft has already stated that in the second half of this year, they will be confident in their ability to serve customers in the AI space for the short term.

Nvidia generated $17 billion from sales in China in the 12 months that ended Jan. 26, 13% of its total revenue.\n\nThe surge in demand presents a challenge, as Nvidia must decide whether to proceed with making the chips so it can pocket the revenue or risk wasting the effort if the ban materializes.\n\nThe H20 is the most powerful AI chip Nvidia is permitted to sell to China since U.S. export controls banned sale of the companyâ€™s most advanced chips in the country based on national security concerns. H20s are 15 times slower in making calculations than Nvidiaâ€™s Blackwell chips, which the company sells in most markets outside China.\n\nHowever, Nvidia recently upgraded the H20 by combining it with the same powerful, high-bandwidth memory chips it uses for the Blackwell system, according to the two people with direct knowledge of the H20 orders. Most Chinese companies have ordered the upgraded version, which bolsters performance for training and running AI, these people said.\n\nPresident Donald Trumpâ€™s administration has been considering banning the sale of H20s to China to further curb Beijingâ€™s technological rise, according to two people with direct knowledge of the deliberations. The threat of a possible ban prompted Chinaâ€™s technology incumbents to increase their orders in recent weeks.\n\nNvidia declined to comment.

This pulls at my sense of prioritization where you make the quick repairs to your tent to keep you dry while you spend your days building the house you really need and best fits your needs.  If you buy into the first principle that the software and silicon are best co-designed, AMD should be re-writing a major amount of the ROCm stack and that is not a new message from AMD. It was either Papermaster or Pang when talking about a unified software stack had said they would be working on it longer term but ROCm development would continue, saying something to the effect \'you don\'t change engines mid flight\'. As AMD moves closser to UDMA and a way from RDNA/CDNA, I\'m still looking for that unified software framework. I\'m sure it will borrow heavily from ROCm and develop an efforts, but there are likely large sections that will be not be brought over. Perhaps RCCL is one, perhaps not.

Also itâ€™s important to hedge. Straddles/strangles are your friend. That way you can profit on a big move in either direction, though of course the move will have to be larger than a naked call, but the puts will help counteract your losses from your calls. Straddles have saved my ass many timesâ€¦ But donâ€™t do it 2 days from exp. Buying a put along with a call basically doubles your exposure to time decay so you want to minimize theta with further expiration dates. (I almost never exercise options, just sell them to the next sucker who will pay more). Itâ€™s not too late to re-evaluate your position, though that likely involves selling for a loss tomorrow.

(This was your mistake here unless you have enough funds and plan to exercise the option aka buy the 100 shares if itâ€™s at the strike price at the time of expiration.\n\nBig thing youâ€™re missing here - You donâ€™t only make money after it hits your strike price or more; *you begin to gain/lose money the second you fill the contract* So if it were $106 when you bought the $110 strike contract - and it goes to $109, youâ€™re making money already. Likewise the vice versa if it were to drop in price.\n\nThe strike price is $110, based off your contract info - you bought the contract when it was $107. Say tomorrow it shootâ€™s up to $118. You make money from 107-118. The strike price becomes relevant in the sense that if it becomes $118 and you hold the rights to BUY 100 shares at $110, then on May 2nd at the time of expiration \n\nYou get to buy 110x100 shares for=$11,000 \nAssuming that $118 scenario itâ€™s actually worth 11,800. So should you choose to exercise the option and have the money to do so, the $118 scenario would give you a $800 gain. However, you also have the choice to resell your option/rights to buy 100 shares at any time prior to expiration.\n\nIn this scenario say you bought it at the $107 NVDA cost when you bought this contract and assume today it goes to $108.50, you can sell your contract and make profit from 108.50-107=1.50 x 100 = $150. Youâ€™re making or losing money from the point you buy the contract. \n\nFrom the way I read your post though, your mistake is choosing an expiration date so close if you wish to â€œkeep the ball rollingâ€. The specific contract you chose expires on 5/2 and should it be worth $109, at expiration time itâ€™s now worthless and you lose all your money. This seems like the most common outcome of this specific option you bought. \n\nKey takeaway - you make/lose money from the second you buy a contract and the strike price does not matter much unless you plan to hold the contract to expiration and exercise it, which it does not sound like you plan to do. Iâ€™d recommend rolling the option to a later date because at this rate - based off your picture itâ€™s already dropped 45% for that option.

Hereâ€™s a grounded breakdown to help you think it through:\n\nâ¸»\n\nðŸ“ˆ Reasons It Could Be Worth Holding NVDA:\n\n1. AI Leadership\n\nNVIDIA dominates the market for AI chips (especially GPUs for training large AI models). This sector is expected to keep growing massively over the next decade. Its CUDA ecosystem and dominance in AI frameworks give it a strong competitive moat.\n\n2. Data Centers & Cloud Computing\n\nNVIDIAâ€™s data center business (including its Grace Hopper chips and networking gear from Mellanox) has seen explosive growth. More companies are investing in AI infrastructure, which could drive further demand.\n\n3. Moats in Software + Hardware\n\nItâ€™s not just about chips. NVIDIAâ€™s software stack (CUDA, TensorRT, Omniverse, etc.) makes it harder for competitors to displace them. They offer an integrated platform that rivals like AMD and Intel struggle to match.\n\n4. Strong Financials\n\nAs of recent earnings (May 2025), NVIDIA continues to post massive revenue and earnings growth. Its margins and free cash flow are industry-leading, giving it room for buybacks, R&D, and expansion.\n\nâ¸»\n\nâš ï¸ Reasons to Be Cautious:\n\n1. Valuation Risk\n\nNVDA trades at a premium valuation (high P/E and P/S ratios), even by tech standards. A lot of future growth is priced in. Any slowdown in growth or margin compression could hurt the stock.\n\n2. Competition and Custom Silicon\n\nBig tech (Google, Amazon, Meta) is increasingly building their own chips (TPUs, Inferentia, etc.), which could erode some of NVIDIAâ€™s future sales if these custom chips become more widespread.\n\n3. Geopolitical Exposure\n\nNVIDIA is exposed to China and global chip supply chains. US-China tensions and export restrictions on AI chips could limit growth in international markets.\n\n4. Cyclicality of Semiconductors\n\nSemiconductors are inherently cyclical. A downturn in demand (e.g., from gaming or crypto) could impact the business short-term, even if the long-term outlook is strong.\n\nâ¸»\n\nðŸ§  Bottom Line: Is It Worth Holding for 5 Years?\n\nYes â€” if you believe in:\nÂ Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Continued AI adoption across industries.\nÂ Â Â â€¢Â Â Â NVIDIA retaining a leadership position in AI and accelerated computing.\nÂ Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Market growth that justifies the high current valuation.\n\nBut be cautious â€” if youâ€™re:\nÂ Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Risk-averse to volatility or valuation compression.\nÂ Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Concerned about heavy concentration in one sector (tech/AI).\n\nâ¸»\n\nâœ… Tips If You Do Hold:\nÂ Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Consider position sizing â€” donâ€™t overexpose your portfolio.\nÂ Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Stay updated on earnings and sector trends.\nÂ Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Use dips as potential buying opportunities if your thesis holds.\nÂ Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Think about trimming if it becomes an outsized portion of your portfolio.'),(8990,'NVDA_Stock','1l08rtz','mvc0n6v','2025-06-01',-1,-0.7345,'Jensen and the crew are dumping 240,000 shares per person.
