For starters, they do not have the only search engine. Bing may suck, but it is owned by Microsoft which is in fact a bigger company than Google by market cap - so they could definitely compete if it mattered to them - DuckDuckGo also produces the same thing. The competition which DuckDuckGo offered with their lack of tracking even demonstrates differentiation exists in the market.\n\nMoreover, Google AdWords (their search product) can be manually created on websites by selling ad space to sponsors & placing an ad without the network of Google\'s platform. Outbrain does similar spots.\n\nTechnically speaking, more broadly, search ads are just \"digital marketing\" which also exists on social media, or email. SMS, streaming, etc. are all alternatives to Google.\n\nHell, television & radio can also be places businesses spend money on promotions.\n\nAlso, SEM (Google search result ad locations) are not inherently valuable for other businesses whereas they are more beneficial for certain industries like legal firms.\n\nMicrosoft pioneered this whole fake monopoly act in the 90\'s. All it does is signals to the market that the stock is worth more than it is today, ads speculation which drives the options markets, and ultimately gives the big business a chance to write or re-write the laws.'),(419,'stocks','1gui0ub','lxu3l2o','2024-11-18',1,0,'What is Chrome?
