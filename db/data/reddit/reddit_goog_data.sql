Despite the Chatgpt coming out in late 2022, Google has still been growing revenue and Cashflow quite nicely. \n\nThey have been investing heavily in AI, as has the other big tech companies. But this will be a necessity to stay ahead of strong competition. \n\nTheir Cloud growth in the recent quarters has been phenomenal with 35% YoY growth. Their run rate is roughly north of $40B. They\'re still third place vs Azure and AWS but are growing well and catching up. \n\nTheir Search still grew about 12-13% in the latest quarter. So that is still doing well. \n\nThey have been investing heavily in improving their AI with Gemini and integrating it with their many products. \n\nWhich products? Search, YouTube, Gmail, android... Which are dominant in their respective markets. Plus Google drive/docs/sheets/etc which they are less dominant in but still helps. \n\nSearch is still the go-to for vast majority of internet users. Google added in AI overviews and personally I\'ve found them very useful. People are going to ask more complex questions of Search and google will start answering them in Search. The way we Search will change, and if they can combine/integrate Search with Gemini, it will do wonders. \n\nRemember, Google Search already has a huge number of users. So any improvements they make will scale across all of them. \n\nIs Gemini better than Chatgpt? I don\'t think so, yet. But I\'m using the free version. Rumour is Gemini 2.0 will release in December so we\'ll see how it fairs with Chatgpt. But apparently rumour is all the LLMs are hitting a \"wall\" or not seeing as much improvement in their LLMs now. So it may become a closer playing field. \n\nYou mentioned Waymo. Personally, that\'s just so far away from becoming a big part of Alphabet revenues... They need a lot of capex to make it big. And I\'m personally, not sure how big the market is for it to be worth it. I suspect they will lease it out rather than owning the entire process. \n\nHowever. **The DOJ antitrust lawsuit is a risk**. This is the one that is pushing the stock to 20 pe. It really depends on your comfort level and what you think will happen. Personally, I think the end result will be Google has to change their business practices where they can not pay to be default, and pay a fine. They are fighting *hard* against the Chrome sell off. There is a lot more that the DOJ is asking all of which, I personally think is ridiculous. The problem is paying to be default.

So they will have to find more ways to be unique and competitive. \n\nGoogles products like Search, Gmail, Chrome, Google Drive, Google Maps, YouTube, Android, Photos, Google Workspace and anything else I can\'t recall have at least 1 Billion users.

And it had a counter in the corner showing that the amount of free email storage you had was growing faster than you could use it.\n\nEvery month or two, google would have a new free feature that felt like wizardry.

Huge room for growth / expansion here. \n* 8% stake in SpaceX (space exploration / telecom replacement): SpaceX could replace all telecoms one day so having an 8% stake here is quite significant.\n* Tensorflow / TPUs: they could easily spin this off and work on creating a competitor to Nvidia (3 trillion dollar market cap at the moment). \n* Leaders in quantum computing: yup, leaders here as well and market share here would be enormous albeit this is still years away and lots of things could happen. \n* Google Cloud (10% of worldwide cloud market and growing (with ML offerings / focus)) -- lots of room to capture market share here as well.\n* Google Suite / Workspace (Gmail, Sheets, Docs, Chats, Calendar, etc...): still room to grow and capture more of the enterprise market.\n* Google Pixel (only 1% market share of SmartPhone market) -- lots of room for growth.\n* Google Nest - leader in smart-home devices and ditto - lots of room to grow and expand profit margins.\n* Fitbit (number one in consumer wearables / smart fitness market): more room to improve earnings.\n* GoogleG (late stage investments) / Google Ventures (early stage investments) / Gradient Ventures.
