Despite the Chatgpt coming out in late 2022, Google has still been growing revenue and Cashflow quite nicely. \n\nThey have been investing heavily in AI, as has the other big tech companies. But this will be a necessity to stay ahead of strong competition. \n\nTheir Cloud growth in the recent quarters has been phenomenal with 35% YoY growth. Their run rate is roughly north of $40B. They\'re still third place vs Azure and AWS but are growing well and catching up. \n\nTheir Search still grew about 12-13% in the latest quarter. So that is still doing well. \n\nThey have been investing heavily in improving their AI with Gemini and integrating it with their many products. \n\nWhich products? Search, YouTube, Gmail, android... Which are dominant in their respective markets. Plus Google drive/docs/sheets/etc which they are less dominant in but still helps. \n\nSearch is still the go-to for vast majority of internet users. Google added in AI overviews and personally I\'ve found them very useful. People are going to ask more complex questions of Search and google will start answering them in Search. The way we Search will change, and if they can combine/integrate Search with Gemini, it will do wonders. \n\nRemember, Google Search already has a huge number of users. So any improvements they make will scale across all of them. \n\nIs Gemini better than Chatgpt? I don\'t think so, yet. But I\'m using the free version. Rumour is Gemini 2.0 will release in December so we\'ll see how it fairs with Chatgpt. But apparently rumour is all the LLMs are hitting a \"wall\" or not seeing as much improvement in their LLMs now. So it may become a closer playing field. \n\nYou mentioned Waymo. Personally, that\'s just so far away from becoming a big part of Alphabet revenues... They need a lot of capex to make it big. And I\'m personally, not sure how big the market is for it to be worth it. I suspect they will lease it out rather than owning the entire process. \n\nHowever. **The DOJ antitrust lawsuit is a risk**. This is the one that is pushing the stock to 20 pe. It really depends on your comfort level and what you think will happen. Personally, I think the end result will be Google has to change their business practices where they can not pay to be default, and pay a fine. They are fighting *hard* against the Chrome sell off. There is a lot more that the DOJ is asking all of which, I personally think is ridiculous. The problem is paying to be default.

And it had a counter in the corner showing that the amount of free email storage you had was growing faster than you could use it.\n\nEvery month or two, google would have a new free feature that felt like wizardry.

Huge room for growth / expansion here. \n* 8% stake in SpaceX (space exploration / telecom replacement): SpaceX could replace all telecoms one day so having an 8% stake here is quite significant.\n* Tensorflow / TPUs: they could easily spin this off and work on creating a competitor to Nvidia (3 trillion dollar market cap at the moment). \n* Leaders in quantum computing: yup, leaders here as well and market share here would be enormous albeit this is still years away and lots of things could happen. \n* Google Cloud (10% of worldwide cloud market and growing (with ML offerings / focus)) -- lots of room to capture market share here as well.\n* Google Suite / Workspace (Gmail, Sheets, Docs, Chats, Calendar, etc...): still room to grow and capture more of the enterprise market.\n* Google Pixel (only 1% market share of SmartPhone market) -- lots of room for growth.\n* Google Nest - leader in smart-home devices and ditto - lots of room to grow and expand profit margins.\n* Fitbit (number one in consumer wearables / smart fitness market): more room to improve earnings.\n* GoogleG (late stage investments) / Google Ventures (early stage investments) / Gradient Ventures.

Search: LLMs are a Real Risk, But the Analysis is Conservative\n\nâœ… Agree: LLMs like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Grok threaten traditional Google Search by offering direct answers instead of links.\nâŒ Pushback: The 5% annual growth assumption for Search may be too low.\n	â€¢	Even if Google loses market share, the overall ad market is expanding (e.g., retail media, AI-enhanced search ads).\n	â€¢	Google still dominates commercial searches in travel, auto, shopping, and health, where transactional intent is high.\n	â€¢	Search is still high-margin (40%), and a 10x PE multiple is likely too lowâ€”a more reasonable 12-15x PE could be justified.\n\nðŸ”¹ Revised Valuation Range: Instead of $885B, a more realistic range could be $1.0T to $1.3T.\n\n2. YouTube: Strong Growth, But Valuation Might Be Too Aggressive\n\nâœ… Agree: YouTube is a powerhouse, with strong ad revenue growth and subscriptions (YouTube Premium, YouTube TV) contributing more to margins.\nâŒ Pushback: Comparing YouTubeâ€™s PE multiple directly to Netflix (40x) is aggressive.\n	â€¢	Netflix is subscription-based, while YouTube is ad-heavy, and ad businesses are historically valued lower than pure subscription plays.\n	â€¢	25% margin assumption is reasonable, but a 30x PE is more appropriate than 40x.\n\nðŸ”¹ Revised Valuation Range: Instead of $634B, a more conservative estimate is $450B to $550B.\n\n3. Google Cloud: This Is the Most Undervalued Segment\n\nâœ… Agree: Google Cloud is improving rapidlyâ€”its market share is growing, and margins are catching up to AWS.\nâŒ Pushback: 40x PE on cloud profits is aggressive.\n	â€¢	AWS is the industry leader, and itâ€™s valued at ~25-30x earnings at best.\n	â€¢	A 25% revenue CAGR for five years is possible, but this valuation assumes a perfect execution scenario.\n\nðŸ”¹ Revised Valuation Range: Instead of $1.9T, a more reasonable estimate is $1.2T to $1.5T.\n\n4. Subscriptions & Devices: Growing, But Not a Major Driver\n\nâœ… Agree: Googleâ€™s hardware (Pixel, Fitbit, Nest) and subscriptions (YouTube Premium, Google One) are growing.\nâŒ Pushback: This business lacks pricing power, and margins might be lower than assumed (20% instead of 25%).\n\nðŸ”¹ Revised Valuation Range: Instead of $403B, more realistic range is $250B to $350B.\n\n5. Waymo: Pure Speculation\n\nâœ… Agree: Waymo has potential, but self-driving is years away from serious monetization.\nâŒ Pushback: The $45B valuation is outdated, and thereâ€™s no clear path to profitability.\n	â€¢	Realistically, Waymoâ€™s fair value today is closer to $15B-$30B.\n\nðŸ”¹ Revised Valuation Range: $15B to $30B instead of $45B.\n\n6. Total Valuation Adjusted for More Realistic Assumptions\n\nIf we adjust the PE multiples and assumptions based on a more conservative outlook:\n\nSegment	SOAP Valuation ($B)	Adjusted Range ($B)\nSearch	885	1,000 - 1,300\nYouTube	634	450 - 550\nCloud	1,900	1,200 - 1,500\nSubscriptions	403	250 - 350\nWaymo	45	15 - 30\nTotal Pre-Tax	3,867	2,915 - 3,730\nAfter 20% Tax	3,094	2,332 - 2,984\n\nSo instead of $3.1T, I think Google is more realistically valued at $2.3T to $2.98T.\n\n7. Is Google Undervalued?\n\nAt todayâ€™s market cap (~$1.8T):\n	â€¢	If you use the lower estimate ($2.3T) â†’ Google is ~28% undervalued.\n	â€¢	If you use the higher estimate ($2.98T) â†’ Google is ~65% undervalued.\n\nðŸš€ If you believe Google will maintain dominance in AI, Search, and Cloud, itâ€™s undervalued.\nâš ï¸ If you think Search is collapsing faster than expected, itâ€™s closer to fair value.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nâœ… I mostly agree with this thesis, but some valuations are too aggressive (Cloud, YouTube, Search multiples).\nâœ… Google is undervalued, but likely by 20-40%, not massively like 70-100%.\nâœ… Google Cloud is the hidden growth engine, and if AI adoption accelerates, this stock could break $2.5T+.'),(1685,'ValueInvesting','1j0td4b','mfekryz','2025-03-01',2,-0.3321,'As long as there are so many posts about Alphabet Iâ€™ll wait.

Nevertheless, google search corresponds to 56% of google\'s revenue (Lets assume 50% for simplicity).

I personally use Pixel, and it is very easy to access Gemini and it is a pretty solid LLM.  HOWEVER, I do use gpt as well.  In my view, google presents a massive opportunity right now because all the other Mag 7 are \"buffed up\" in valuation.  There\'s fear that they\'ll lose their dominance, but that\'s not going to kill or dent their exponential growth in AI. \n\nWhen you think of AI, I would urge you to consider thinking in terms of ecosystem. Yes chatpgt is a phenomenal app, very sticky too. But the companies that have end to end deeply entrenched ecosystems will win. In Google\'s case, they have android and they have the opportunity to embed AI at the operating system level, phone, email, text, search, video, etc etc etc. \n\nOpen AI of course has strong backing from Microsoft and the partnership with Oracle and softbank will help them accelerate.

In Q4 it was 13% YoY, and between 12-14% for each quarter of 2024. And they are investing heavily into improving it with AI overviews.

With the bigger competitors being Amazon (and I think Meta) and other areas. \n\nIf someone goes on a web browser, and Searches on an Amazon search bar, and clicks on a link, that Ad $ goes to Amazon instead of Google. That is competition. If they are on their phone and open the amazon app and search for a product there instead of a Google search, that is competition. And this extends to Facebook Marketplace, or Walmart or anything else. \n\nSo google has always had strong competition in Search. And despite this, their Search revenue continues to grow. Their revenue growth in 2024 for each quarter has been in the 12-14% range. This is despite the, honestly amazing hear in LLM improvements that have happened with Thinking models from OpenAI. \n\nSince LLMs like ChatGPT have come out back in 2022, Google Search has continued to earn and grow revenue in double digits. Advertisers are still using Google. And people are still using Google. \n\nBut that\'s right now. What about future? \n\nWell. Google has recently started rolling out, what I personally have been thinking/saying what they have needed to do for a long time. And that is integrate their Gemini 2.0 into Google Search. So users will (and already are) ask Google Search more and more complex queries. There is a new AI mode added to Google Search (rolling out). So users can ask a question on Search, and use the AI mode to dig deeper with Gemini. This is the new future of Google Search. It is no longer just blue link economy. \n\nYouTube is growing in double digits as well, so not much to say there. They have more users than Netflix. \n\nThen there is Google Cloud. Google Cloud in the last 2 quarters has grown 35% and 30% respectively. And they are limited in revenue by supply. Their Demand > Supply for Google Cloud. And even before that, their revenue was growing +20% per year. Their Gross Margin has been improving and in latest quarter is 17.5%. AWS in comparison has +35% in margin. So Google can very well achieve that looking long-term. \n\nAnd a fun fact. Google Cloud has a higher annual revenue, than YouTube! It\'s crazy to me! \n\nFor their Gemini AI, it may not be the *best* model compared to the best OpenAI has to offer. But for developers using their API it is, *by far* the most affordable and cheapest. It is very much the best value for money option for developers to use. Developers are using the Gemini 2.0 Flash API to build their own apps with AI. And Gemini 2.0 is a popular option. \n\nAlso, google has focused their AI for Multimodality. So that\'s it\'s not just a text based AI model. It can take it sound, images, video, live feed. And they are soon releasing this in Project Astra. They are leaders in multimodality. \n\nYes, they still have very strong competition from OpenAI, and Anthropic, and xAI, and Microsoft. But google is no where far behind at all. \n\nOh, and google has the entire AI stack in their hands. They have their TPU hardware which Gemini 100% runs on, so they are not depending on the Nvidia tax. They own the software and have decades of experience in AI. They have all of it. \n\nAnd they are integrating it anywhere they can. They\'re giving away Gemini Code Assist for free to compete with Claude 3.7. It\'s not as Good as Claude 3.7, but nothing beats free. \n\nThey also released the AI Co-Scientist which uses multiple AI agents together to support scientists in their work. \n\nThere\'s other stuff I don\'t recall off top of my head now. \n\nI know they are performing very strong in Waymo. They are ahead of all competition, especially Tesla. But I\'m unsure how far ahead they are against Chinese companies. \n\nPersonally, it\'s hard for me to figure where they go or how far they go with Waymo. I mean, it\'s very capex intensive imo.

That\'s adsense, and represents 10% of revenue.  Also, \"Youtube revenue\" also worth 10%. These are all \"adwords,\" the actual product. \n\n# \"Google Other\" & \"Google Cloud\"Â are the non-advertising revenue... representing 22.5% of Alphabet revenue. That includes pixel phones, software sales, cloud services, etc. \n\nI would also suggest (speculative, but IMO safe)that (a) non advertising revenue generates lowers profit and still relies on the ad business to make sense. User data\'s highest value use tends to be ad targeting.  \n\nThere is more to this than \"active user engagement.\" Reddit has a lot of active users. So does Bing. Neither generate anywhere near Google (or FB) levels of revenue from these engaged users. \n\nThat\'s because users are not \"customers,\" not consumers. Advertisers are the customers. \n\nSo... advertising. Adsense and (to a large extent) Youtube revenue piggy-backs on search. Search is the quality product... and Adsense is sub-premium extra that advertisers toggle in if/when they have maxed out their search spend... or by accident. These only sells because it\'s part of adwords\n\nUsers that search for \"*online casino*\" or \"*divorce lawyer near me*\" are worth >$10 per click.  Users that search for \"online shoe store\" are worth <$1 per click. Most searches like \"how to cook eggs\" aren\'t worth anything. Searches in some markets (eg Manhattan) are worth way more than searches in other markets... Eg Manila. Way, way more. 10X. 100X. 1000X. These are not differences that average out. \n\nThe LLM threat to google adwords is three-fold. (1) How much market share will google have? (2) How valuable is LLM advertising (a product that doesn\'t exist yet) compared to search? and (3) What parts of google search usage is affected *early* by LLM encroachment. \n\nFor #1 & #2, I think the only way to go is down. They are already so dominant, that there are no gains to be made. Only losses. #3  is where the hope is. It is very possible that \"premium searches\" will continue in the LLM age.

But their competition is not Being search. It is anywhere that has a search bar where people go to search for something (like you said, shopping) and click on a link that drives revenue for Google. \n\nImplication? Amazon is the competitor against google. Why? Because if a person wants to find a product to buy, and goes to the Amazon app instead of opening their browser for Google search, google loses that revenue and Amazon gains. Why? Because amazon has sponsored Links in their searches. And when you click on them, amazon gains as revenue which grew 18% in their recent quarter. \n\nLooking at it this way though, google has had a lot of competition for *years*. People are looking for products on their apps more than ever. Using Amazon, or Facebook marketplace, or Instagram, or TikTok, and so on. And now it is chatgpt. I haven\'t used chatgpt in a bit, but what I\'ve seen online, is it doesn\'t provide links to stuff in their results? So people don\'t really click on anything. I suspect if/when this changes and there are sponsored Links, then it will be another source of competition that is taking Google\'s ad revenue. \n\nI\'ve noticed that google Gemini, depending on what you\'re asking it, does provide links to stuff you are asking about. So maybe that will help give it some revenue. Not sure though. \n\nImo, google needs to do better with their shopping search experience. I get results for stuff that are crap. But that\'s anecdotal. \n\nEither way. If LLMs want to make revenue. They\'ll have to add in sponsored ads somehow at some point. That means adding in links or something for related products. \n\nI do wonder why not have a \"Shopping LLM\" from chatgpt or Google. It will help you look for products to click on...

I work with Google-related products (like Google Ads and Google Workspace) every day and think about this a lot, I see it a bit differently.\n\nYou\'re right that Google has shifted heavily toward commercial intent because that is where the money is. But the bigger shift is cultural. For the past two decades, Google was the starting point of the internet. \"Just Google it\" became second nature. That cultural dominance is what kept them at the center of everything.\n\nI think that era is ending. People, especially younger users, do not want to scroll through 10 blue links anymore. They expect answers immediately, either directly inside the search results (through AI Overviews and snippets) or by skipping Google entirely and going straight to Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, or ChatGPT.\n\nIt was never just about shopping or knowledge. Google\'s real strength was being the place where every online journey started. If that habit changes, even slowly, their dominance is at risk. Not because they are bad at commercial searches, but because people may stop thinking of Google as their first stop.\n\n(And ironically, by stuffing search results with more ads, Google might actually be speeding up that shift.)  \n  \nBigger picture, the way people use the internet and how online traffic moves is going to change drastically in the next decade. Affiliate sites, SEO-driven businesses, and entire ecosystems that rely on traditional search are already getting hit. The internet we know today is going to look completely different, and Google will have to adapt fast to stay at the center of it.  \n  \nThat said, I still think Google is a very strong company with huge potential to diversify further. Their days are definitely not over. But if AI-driven answers become the new standard, it will be much harder to monetize them the same way they monetize traditional search ads.

I very much believe that right now, with the AI risk and the DOJ trials, to invest in Google, you need the stomach for it. A strong one. \n\nThe good news first. Google has Google Cloud growing very well, YouTube growing double digits, Waymo has a great future, Google Deep Mind is an amazing research arm publishing a ton of papers so they are a leader in AI, a number of their products have, I think +2 billion users such as Search, Gmail, Maps, Android, YouTube, and so on. In addition to a lot of their products being very well connected to each other. \n\nHowever. The AI risk is real. Google Search is currently ~60% I\'d their revenue but shrinking as GCP grows. \n\nThe future of Google will lie in how well they integrate AI into their Google search. Their Gemini 2.5 is amazing and is probably the best or second best AI model LLM depending on who you ask. It\'s the most affordable for API for developers. It can be integrated, or is integrated with all of their products, including Google Cloud. \n\nSo this is why I am still an investor. Because google is not closing their ears saying \"people will still use Search, they won\'t use AI because it\'s inaccurate\". *They are investing heavily to build the best AI models on the planet*. \n\nThey\'ve begun integrating AI overviews and AI mode into Google search. They\'ve got great usage from AI overviews. And AI mode is new but looks very usable. Combining Gemini with Google search will be key for their future. \n\nAnother thing that I don\'t see talked about much. Companies like OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, Meta, etc. They\'re all investing many many billions of dollars to build data centers, pay for R&D, training runs, Inference, etc. This is incredibly expensive. Very expensive. \n\nEven as the cost of AI goes down (cost per token), the cost to continue to develop strong models to stay ahead (people want to use the best model not 4th best), and pay for the inference cost... Is very high. I do not believe subscription revenue will be enough to account for this. I think Altman even said recently on twitter that they are not able to keep up because it costs so much. \n\nThe future of AI LLMs lies in adding in ads. It *will* happen. It\'s the only way it makes sense without charging per token to users. At that point, use will go down because the average person doesn\'t want to pay for each token they use. \n\nSo, when ads goes into LLMs. Google has the key advantage. They have the relationships built. They have the ad ecosystem in place. They have the data. The know how. The experience. The, everything really. To monetize and make it profitable, and ideally make it still user friendly. \n\nSo to me, long-term, I do believe google has a big challenge and mountain in front of them.  It they are fighting hard and making the right moves.

I very much believe that right now, with the AI risk and the DOJ trials, to invest in Google, you need the stomach for it. A strong one.\n\nThe good news first. Google has Google Cloud growing very well, YouTube growing double digits, Waymo has a great future, Google Deep Mind is an amazing research arm publishing a ton of papers so they are a leader in AI, a number of their products have, I think +2 billion users such as Search, Gmail, Maps, Android, YouTube, and so on. In addition to a lot of their products being very well connected to each other.\n\nHowever. The AI risk is real. Google Search is currently ~60% I\'d their revenue but shrinking as GCP grows.\n\nThe future of Google will lie in how well they integrate AI into their Google search. Their Gemini 2.5 is amazing and is probably the best or second best AI model LLM depending on who you ask. It\'s the most affordable for API for developers. It can be integrated, or is integrated with all of their products, including Google Cloud.\n\nSo this is why I am still an investor. Because google is not closing their ears saying \"people will still use Search, they won\'t use AI because it\'s inaccurate\". They are investing heavily to build the best AI models on the planet.\n\nThey\'ve begun integrating AI overviews and AI mode into Google search. They\'ve got great usage from AI overviews. And AI mode is new but looks very usable. Combining Gemini with Google search will be key for their future.\n\nAnother thing that I don\'t see talked about much. Companies like OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, Meta, etc. They\'re all investing many many billions of dollars to build data centers, pay for R&D, training runs, Inference, etc. This is incredibly expensive. Very expensive.\n\nEven as the cost of AI goes down (cost per token), the cost to continue to develop strong models to stay ahead (people want to use the best model not 4th best), and pay for the inference cost... Is very high. I do not believe subscription revenue will be enough to account for this. I think Altman even said recently on twitter that they are not able to keep up because it costs so much.\n\nThe future of AI LLMs lies in adding in ads. It will happen. It\'s the only way it makes sense without charging per token to users. At that point, use will go down because the average person doesn\'t want to pay for each token they use.\n\nSo, when ads goes into LLMs. Google has the key advantage. They have the relationships built. They have the ad ecosystem in place. They have the data. The know how. The experience. The, everything really. To monetize and make it profitable, and ideally make it still user friendly.\n\nSo to me, long-term, I do believe google has a big challenge and mountain in front of them. It they are fighting hard and making the right moves. And long-term, they have the tools, and know how to get it right.\n\nBut God, I wish they\'d stop buybacks and invest more in the business like Amazon.'),(2712,'ValueInvesting','1kjuilb','mrqj1v2','2025-05-11',10,0.7832,'I\'d say it\'s the best investment of the 7 big guys.\n\nHowever, I\'d look more at value and non-US stocks at this time.'),(2713,'ValueInvesting','1kjuilb','mrq4k0i','2025-05-11',10,0.4261,'â€œThey have problems beyond legal and product quality, but they are just so solid from a fundamental perspective.â€\n\nSeems mutually exclusive.'),(2714,'ValueInvesting','1kjuilb','mrrof6q','2025-05-11',6,0.1779,'Everyday I see at least 10 posts on fin reddit that Google is such a good investment.

I very much believe that right now, with the AI risk and the DOJ trials, to invest in Google, you need the stomach for it. A strong one.\n\nThe good news first. Google has Google Cloud growing very well, YouTube growing double digits, Waymo has a great future, Google Deep Mind is an amazing research arm publishing a ton of papers so they are a leader in AI, a number of their products have, I think +2 billion users such as Search, Gmail, Maps, Android, YouTube, and so on. In addition to a lot of their products being very well connected to each other.\n\nHowever. The AI risk is real. Google Search is currently ~60% I\'d their revenue but shrinking as GCP grows.\n\nThe future of Google will lie in how well they integrate AI into their Google search. Their Gemini 2.5 is amazing and is probably the best or second best AI model LLM depending on who you ask. It\'s the most affordable for API for developers. It can be integrated, or is integrated with all of their products, including Google Cloud.\n\nSo this is why I am still an investor. Because google is not closing their ears saying \"people will still use Search, they won\'t use AI because it\'s inaccurate\". They are investing heavily to build the best AI models on the planet.\n\nThey\'ve begun integrating AI overviews and AI mode into Google search. They\'ve got great usage from AI overviews. And AI mode is new but looks very usable. Combining Gemini with Google search will be key for their future.\n\nAnother thing that I don\'t see talked about much. Companies like OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, Meta, etc. They\'re all investing many many billions of dollars to build data centers, pay for R&D, training runs, Inference, etc. This is incredibly expensive. Very expensive.\n\nEven as the cost of AI goes down (cost per token), the cost to continue to develop strong models to stay ahead (people want to use the best model not 4th best), and pay for the inference cost... Is very high. I do not believe subscription revenue will be enough to account for this. I think Altman even said recently on twitter that they are not able to keep up because it costs so much.\n\nThe future of AI LLMs lies in adding in ads. It will happen. It\'s the only way it makes sense without charging per token to users. At that point, use will go down because the average person doesn\'t want to pay for each token they use.\n\nSo, when ads goes into LLMs. Google has the key advantage. They have the relationships built. They have the ad ecosystem in place. They have the data. The know how. The experience. The, everything really. To monetize and make it profitable, and ideally make it still user friendly.\n\nSo to me, long-term, I do believe google has a big challenge and mountain in front of them. It they are fighting hard and making the right moves. And long-term, they have the tools, and know how to get it right.\n\nBut God, I wish they\'d stop buybacks and invest more in the business like Amazon.'),(2834,'ValueInvesting','1ksqskx','mtqpwbo','2025-05-22',0,0.9501,'Alphabet is great value even at these prices after the rebound in april.\n\nThe net income last quarter had a large boost from the updated valuation of their SpaceX holding.

You could even get it at a PE in the mid-20s at its lows, much lower than AAPL (despite having much more robust growth) and AMZN (which has traditionally had higher PE ratios). Now, with nothing really fundamentally changed other than the perception that its slightly more tariff resistant, the script has flipped, its PE has gone up to the high 30s and it trades at a premium to AAPL (which I believe is deserved) and even AMZN.\n\nWill the same happen to GOOG? Not sure. I would think that based on its income, growth profile, revenue streams, and other bets that it it should be priced at a similar valuation to MSFT and at a premium to AAPL.

This used to be an ideal business: near-zero marginal costs, limited capex, and (what used to be considered) the widest moat of any business. This allowed for very high margins.\n\nChatGPT and Perplexity (and countless other GenAI tools) have taken market share from Google Search. The moat is considerably weaker than it was back in 2022.\n\nIn order to retain market share, Google has been making large investments in GenAI. The problem is that GenAI costs the company a considerable amount of money every time a user makes a query, at least for now. This would probably show up as a combination of COGS expenses, operational expenses, and server depreciation. *The important thing here is that in order to retain market share, Google\'s true marginal cost of goods sold must increase from near-zero to non-zero.* This makes it a significantly less attractive business. We should expect margins to contract in the coming years.\n\nWe should also expect Google to hide these expenses. Google recently updated its accounting practices to extend server life from 3 years to 4 years in 2021, and then from 4 years to 6 years in 2023. This is in an environment where their business model is shifting to demand more strain on compute infrastructure. This is also in an environment where they are in a technological race to capture AI market share and are demanding the latest and best compute infrastructure. Any advancement in chips has the potential to render their old investment essentially obsolete. Server depreciation costs haven\'t really been significant so far, but I believe they will become increasingly significant. In this environment, I don\'t think it makes sense to extend the useful life of its servers, so this is a red flag to me. I think that Google may be using creative accounting to hide the true costs of its shift to AI. \n\nThis is all on top of the antitrust lawsuit and general macroeconomic uncertainty. Foreign duties on digital services are still not off the table. \n\nTechnological developments have the potential to drive Google\'s future, but it\'s fair to say that *the business model and unit economics are fundamentally weaker than they were five years ago*, and that the outlook is much more uncertain.\n\nETA Buffett quote: \"It\'s always better to make a lot of money without putting up anything than it is to make a lot of money by putting up a lot of money.\"'),(3292,'ValueInvesting','1lh1lf4','mz0sv9k','2025-06-21',7,0.9003,'One thing I\'ve noticed about stock prices is they tend to be quite sensitive to anticipated near term events.

Absolutely yes. But does the market love it right now? No. \n\nThis is actually a **good thing** for the long term investor, because that short term impatience creates opportunity for those willing to wait'),(3293,'ValueInvesting','1lh1lf4','mz197r5','2025-06-21',8,0.8622,'Google bull here, around 25% of my portfolio at the moment. \n\nThat said, I do understand the uncertainty here. The antitrust lawsuits could materially harm their distribution monopoly. Divesting chrome would sting, losing the default option could be harmful when people are offered ChatGPT instead when setting up an account, and selling their proprietary data would weaken the personalization moat they\'ve built into search. \n\nOn the competition side, ChatGPT is dominating the non-enterprise LLM world right now. The numbers vary depending on what source you use, but from a purely anecdotal standpoint, the only one that has become a verb to the general populace is ChatGPT. Gemini will likely carve out a nice little slice of that pie for itself over time, but I would be somewhat surprised if ChatGPT isn\'t the de facto #1 player in 5 years from the casual/consumer market for LLM\'s.\n\nFrom an investment perspective, this is one of those situations where the very real negative points against Google have led to an irrationally depressed stock price. Search will probably stagnate in a few years, but it will still be an enormous cash cow for years to come with possible margin expansion. YouTube and Cloud are worth over a trillion dollars today using reasonable valuations. Android represents huge optionality and levers to pull for monetization. The balance sheet is absolutely pristine. Gemini/Google One subscriptions will start to really move the needle over the next few years. Waymo has enormous potential if execution remains strong. Deepmind continues to innovate and any one of their inventions could be monumental. Google ventures owns meaningful slices of tomorrow\'s titans like SpaceX, Anthropic, and Stripe.

These are not overreactions, they are genuine existential concerns where the effect of each is debatable but concerning nonetheless.\n\nSecond, AI is still in the beginning phase and it is still not a profitable venture YET. The only company actively making money from AI is TSMC, Nvidia, and other less consequential companies handing out shovels for this gold rush. Even then, we still do not know how profitable AI-powered searches and LLMâ€™s will be and whether or not itâ€™ll be enough to offset Googleâ€™s search revenue.\n\nThird, the antitrust case is very concerning with how intense it is. I do not think the judge will be heavy-handed with the remedies, but the uncertainty is still instilling a ton of fear into investors. Again, search is king and anything that will potentially impact it, like losing Chrome, will follow with a major sell-off.\n\nI do think that Google has a bunch of promise excluding these factors though and I am pretty confident in Googleâ€™s ability to effectively monetize AI as they are the tried and tested masters of ad monetizing. There is also Youtube, Waymoâ€™s potential, and Google Cloudâ€™s fast growth which will generate a ton of value moving forward.\n\nTLDR: Very promising future but very serious short to medium-term headwinds.

More than every other tech company on the planet.\n\nThen in 2025 so far it is the same story.  Google has made more than NVDA, TSLA, MSFT, AAPL, META, etc.  But then also growing at double digits.  Yet Google is by far the cheapest of the Mag 7.   Google\'s pricing is as insane as TSLA pricing but just the opposite ends of the spectrum.\n\nBut that is only half the story.  The other have is how insanely well positioned Google is for what is coming over the next decade.\n\nThere is no company anywhere near as well positioned and that is no accident.\n\nGoogle\'s vision since basically inception is for what is now possible today.  With much of what is possible today thanks to Google.\n\nGoogle is the only company that has the entire stack.   They had far better vision than Microsoft and everyone else with starting the TPUs over 12 years ago.\n\nNow has the seventh generation in production while only now Microsoft is going to try to copy them.  Same with Amazon.\n\nI am old and pride myself on seeing what is coming.  It has made me a lot of money in the past.   I for example got started on the Internet in 1986.   When the Internet first hit front pages in 1988 with the worm my parents called me to ask me about what is going on with MY Internet.    As I had been going on endlessly on the Internet since first got access.   So I invested accordingly.  Purchased our house and raised 8 kids in the house that I purchased outright using money I had made off of CSCO.\n\nBut AI is so, so much bigger.   The amounts of money that will be made because of AI will dwarf the Internet.   With by far the company best positioned being Google.  It is really not close.   They are on a tier of their own.  But then there is also a single company on tier 2.  Microsoft.  They will do really well also.\n\nOne of the most important reasons Google is so well positioned is the fact they are so far out in front in terms of AI research.   Most of the core things being used by everyone today were Google innovations.  The obvious one is Attention is all you need.   But that is only one example. There are countless other things that are now commonly used by everyone that were Google innovations.  One of my favorites is\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec\n\nThe best way to track who is doing the most important AI research instead of fluff is by monitoring papers accepted at the canonical AI research organization, NeurIPS.   The last one Google had twice the papers accepted compared to next best.\n\nBut if you look over the last 15 years you will see Google finished #1 and #2 pretty much every year.  That is because Google use to breakout DeepMind from Google Brain.   This last year, 2024, was the first year they combined the two.\n\nWith all of this said there is one very unusual aspect of Google that you do NOT see from any other of the Mag 7s or really any other technology company.   Google make the huge innovation.  They then patent it.  They then share in papers.  But then they let anyone use for completely free.  Do not even require a license.   This behavior is why they have the top AI researchers in the world.  Because Google lets them publish.\n\nReally the only other company that could act in this same manner would be META.  It is because Google and META have a very unusual corporate structure.\n\nGoogle trades under two stock symbols, GOOG and GOOGL.  GOOG shares have no voting rights.  Because of this structure only 2 shareholders matter.  Brin and Page.  I like this.  Never in the history of man has there ever been a company as powerful as Google.   When over 90% of the earth population have a question they turn to Google.  \n\nIt is a bit insane that this is true and we all allowed it.  But it is where we are at.   I actually fully trust Brin and Page and I rather see them control Google.   It is why you see things like Waymo being so thoughtful in their rollout of Waymo versus other companies that think it is OK to move fast and break things.   But this does hurt valuations.\n\nInvestors care more about money than safety and Google would have a higher multiple if they did roll in a move fast and break things manner.\n\nSorry about the length of this post.  I am very passionate about Google.   I am a techie through and through and there has been a few very special tech companies through the years and Google is easily #1 in what they have given back.

Those peers can fold AI into their businesses with almost no downside, while for Google the story feels more mixed.\n\nOn the upside, Google sits on a treasure trove of daily-use productsâ€”Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Photos, Android, YouTubeâ€”each ready for AI upgrades that could spawn brand-new revenue streams. The company still has an unmatched combination of data, research talent, and compute. And its long-term bets like Waymo, quantum chips, and the health portfolio suddenly look more plausible in an AI-first world.\n\nThe risk, though, is that Alphabetâ€™s ad machine is so big it almost crowds out everything else. If AI chat answers start stealing even a single-digit percentage of classic search queries, the revenue hit lands fast and hard, and Google Cloudâ€™s profit gap is still wide. Add in the inertia of changing a money printer this sizeâ€”without a â€œfounder-CEOâ€ to rip off the Band-Aidâ€”and you can see why some investors worry that execution will lag vision.\n\nAre the ads fears overblown?

GOOGL has very little debt and a huge cash position, which can make net income appear stronger and the P/E artificially low. That doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s undervalued. It just means the accounting metrics make it look that way on the surface.\n \nWhat actually matters to sophisticated investors is how efficiently the company creates value. Thatâ€™s where metrics like MVA Margin and MVA Spread come in. GOOGLâ€™s MVA Margin is over 400% and its MVA Spread is around 390%. That tells you the market values Alphabet far above the capital it has invested and the sales it generates. Itâ€™s seen as a value-creating machine.\n \n Look at its NOPAT multiple, which is around 16.4. Thatâ€™s a better version of P/E because it focuses only on after-tax operating profits. It puts GOOGL in the 84th percentile of its industry. Its EBITDAR multiple is 9.4, which is also well above average. These arenâ€™t signs of a bargain. Theyâ€™re signs of a company being priced for quality and consistency.\n \nSo while the P/E might suggest Alphabet is cheap, the deeper valuation metrics tell a different story. The market isnâ€™t just buying its past earnings. Itâ€™s buying the expectation that GOOGL will keep delivering exceptional returns year after year. Itâ€™s not cheap, itâ€™s trusted and priced for perfection. \n\nAnd thatâ€™s exactly what investors are paying for.\"'),(4113,'ValueInvesting','1mbgo2b','n5m0zth','2025-07-28',84,0.34,'Because the market is irrational. \n\nMost people understand nothing in technology so this gives us loads of opportunities for cheap shares'),(4114,'ValueInvesting','1mbgo2b','n5lxjjh','2025-07-28',74,-0.1779,'Seriously.

In practice, the spread is tiny â€” often pennies â€” and sometimes flips the â€œwrong wayâ€ due to:\n\nLiquidity differences (one class might be more heavily traded on a given day).\n\nIndex fund mechanics (different indices include different classes, so demand can diverge).\n\nArbitrage limits (institutional investors arbitrage away large differences, so the gap never grows much).\n\n\nSo what you saw â€” GOOG at $204.91 vs. GOOGL at $203.90 â€” is not unusual. The difference is basically noise.\n\n\n---\n\nWhy do Starmine ratings differ?\n\nStarmine (Refinitivâ€™s system) doesnâ€™t rate the company directly â€” it aggregates and weights analyst recommendations, earnings estimates, and performance metrics across available tickers.\n\nBecause GOOGL and GOOG are technically separate securities:\n\nDifferent analyst coverage may flow into each ticker (some publish under GOOG, some under GOOGL).\n\nQuant models (like price momentum, earnings revisions, valuation) can diverge slightly if the two tickers are priced even a few cents apart.\n\nResult: you can get different Starmine scores (8.2 Bullish vs. 6.9 Neutral), even though the underlying business is identical.\n\n\nFor practical investing purposes, you can treat the two as interchangeable. Most small investors just pick one and stick with it (many prefer GOOG since it avoids the voting-rights premium and sometimes has slightly higher liquidity).\n\n\n---\n\nâœ… Bottom line:\n\nGOOGL = voting rights, GOOG = no votes.\n\nThe price flip is normal â€” supply/demand quirks, not fundamental.\n\nStarmine rating differences reflect technical quirks in coverage, not a real difference in the companyâ€™s prospects.'),(4573,'ValueInvesting','1mt8tkm','n9a20xx','2025-08-18',6,0.2732,'Well, MYO is cooked.'),(4574,'ValueInvesting','1mt8tkm','n9a3ss7','2025-08-18',10,0.6767,'How can we become investors in early pre ipo businesses?

Books became software, and Amazon beat Barnes & Noble. Movies became software, and Netflix won. Music became software, and Spotify rules over labels.\n\nNow, we\'ve entered a new era in which some software companies could be eaten by AI. This technology makes it easier to use and create new software, challenging established SaaS providers and upending business models.\n\nNew AI versions of software are popping up in a multitude of sectors, such as legal services, graphic design, marketing, HR, and healthcare. What used to be a discrete software product may now be just a series of requests in plain English typed into a chatbot or AI model. AI coding tools are even making it easier for people to create their own software, rather than buy it.\n\n**\'Zero terminal value\'**\n\nThis has profound implications for the software industry and the millions of employees who use and rely on this widespread technology. Wall Street has taken note, with shares of some established software vendors falling dramatically in recent months.\n\n\nThese AI software jitters reached such intensity that RBC analysts had to publish a big research note on Monday telling investors to calm down. They stressed that core systems of record, such as enterprise resource planning software, are likely not at risk. Still, their findings were not that reassuring.\n\n\"Incumbents have to be more careful about relying on incumbency as a default advantage and not take potential AI disruption lightly, especially with greater feature commoditization, moat erosion, and margin pressure on the horizon,\" the RBC analysts wrote.\n\nA day later, these same RBC analysts warned that a \"zero terminal value\" narrative has crept into HubSpot\'s stock, with some investors questioning whether generative AI could displace elements of the software company\'s inbound marketing model. \n\nHubSpot stock is down about 35% this year. Similar concerns have plagued other SaaS companies, such as Salesforce, which has shed roughly 25% in 2025.\n\n**Adobe and graphic designers**\n\nAnother software provider under AI pressure is Adobe. This company was initially thought to be an AI winner, but its stock is down about 20% this year. I think it\'s the perfect example of how generative AI is beginning to undermine software business models and disrupt related jobs.\n\nInside Adobe, some employees have worried about the potential for AI to reduce the need for graphic designers, who are key customers for the company\'s image editing and creation software such as Photoshop and Illustrator.\n\nBusiness Insider\'s Eugene Kim wrote exclusively about this in the summer of 2023. Kim quoted a senior designer at Adobe who warned internally that a business he knew planned to reduce the size of its graphic design team because of new AI text-to-image features. \"Is this what we want?\" he asked colleagues.\n\nAdobe has said it has a history of introducing new technology that leads to more productivity and jobs. Still, this issue has come up on earnings calls, with analysts asking whether easier and cheaper AI image tools could reduce demand for Adobe\'s software.\n\nAs this AI technology becomes more potent, and easier to use for more people, it might reduce demand for the skills of professional graphic designers. AI systems could eliminate 300 million jobs worldwide, including a quarter of those in the arts and design industries, Goldman Sachs has estimated.\n\n**Google\'s banana**\n\nEnter Google. This week, the internet giant released a new AI photo-editing tool and baked it into its Gemini chatbot service. The early version of this tool was called Nano Banana, and I wished they\'d kept the name. Oh well. \n\nUsers of the free version of Gemini now get almost 100 images a day to either edit or create, using simple natural language requests. There\'s also a paid version of the Gemini chatbot that costs $20 a month. This includes up to 1,000 images per day, and offers a host of other features that compete pretty well with ChatGPT.\n\nCompare that to Adobe\'s Photoshop. This is a little harder to use and usually requires some training to become proficient. It costs about $23 a month for individuals and offers very few of the extra AI bells and whistles that Gemini has.\n\nI tried this new Gemini image-editing tool with Business Insider\'s Hugh Langley. It was fast, easy to use, and free. Why would you pay $23 a month for Photoshop when Google offers similar capabilities, either for free or for less money?\n\nAdobe says it\'s integrating AI across its software suite and letting creators seamlessly move work between its apps. Yet on the same day Gemini was upgraded, Adobe adopted Google\'s new AI image model to power some of its own tools â€” hardly a show of in-house strength.\n\nNo surprise: Adobe stock fell on Tuesday when Google\'s launch went live. The shares have lost at least 30% in the past five years, leaving the company worth about $150 billion. Google\'s market capitalization is $2.5 trillion.\n\nFin'),(4661,'ValueInvesting','1n5sj7f','nbv176w','2025-09-01',16,-0.3298,'Disruption is on the way.
