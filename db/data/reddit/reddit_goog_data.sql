Despite the Chatgpt coming out in late 2022, Google has still been growing revenue and Cashflow quite nicely. \n\nThey have been investing heavily in AI, as has the other big tech companies. But this will be a necessity to stay ahead of strong competition. \n\nTheir Cloud growth in the recent quarters has been phenomenal with 35% YoY growth. Their run rate is roughly north of $40B. They\'re still third place vs Azure and AWS but are growing well and catching up. \n\nTheir Search still grew about 12-13% in the latest quarter. So that is still doing well. \n\nThey have been investing heavily in improving their AI with Gemini and integrating it with their many products. \n\nWhich products? Search, YouTube, Gmail, android... Which are dominant in their respective markets. Plus Google drive/docs/sheets/etc which they are less dominant in but still helps. \n\nSearch is still the go-to for vast majority of internet users. Google added in AI overviews and personally I\'ve found them very useful. People are going to ask more complex questions of Search and google will start answering them in Search. The way we Search will change, and if they can combine/integrate Search with Gemini, it will do wonders. \n\nRemember, Google Search already has a huge number of users. So any improvements they make will scale across all of them. \n\nIs Gemini better than Chatgpt? I don\'t think so, yet. But I\'m using the free version. Rumour is Gemini 2.0 will release in December so we\'ll see how it fairs with Chatgpt. But apparently rumour is all the LLMs are hitting a \"wall\" or not seeing as much improvement in their LLMs now. So it may become a closer playing field. \n\nYou mentioned Waymo. Personally, that\'s just so far away from becoming a big part of Alphabet revenues... They need a lot of capex to make it big. And I\'m personally, not sure how big the market is for it to be worth it. I suspect they will lease it out rather than owning the entire process. \n\nHowever. **The DOJ antitrust lawsuit is a risk**. This is the one that is pushing the stock to 20 pe. It really depends on your comfort level and what you think will happen. Personally, I think the end result will be Google has to change their business practices where they can not pay to be default, and pay a fine. They are fighting *hard* against the Chrome sell off. There is a lot more that the DOJ is asking all of which, I personally think is ridiculous. The problem is paying to be default.

And it had a counter in the corner showing that the amount of free email storage you had was growing faster than you could use it.\n\nEvery month or two, google would have a new free feature that felt like wizardry.

Huge room for growth / expansion here. \n* 8% stake in SpaceX (space exploration / telecom replacement): SpaceX could replace all telecoms one day so having an 8% stake here is quite significant.\n* Tensorflow / TPUs: they could easily spin this off and work on creating a competitor to Nvidia (3 trillion dollar market cap at the moment). \n* Leaders in quantum computing: yup, leaders here as well and market share here would be enormous albeit this is still years away and lots of things could happen. \n* Google Cloud (10% of worldwide cloud market and growing (with ML offerings / focus)) -- lots of room to capture market share here as well.\n* Google Suite / Workspace (Gmail, Sheets, Docs, Chats, Calendar, etc...): still room to grow and capture more of the enterprise market.\n* Google Pixel (only 1% market share of SmartPhone market) -- lots of room for growth.\n* Google Nest - leader in smart-home devices and ditto - lots of room to grow and expand profit margins.\n* Fitbit (number one in consumer wearables / smart fitness market): more room to improve earnings.\n* GoogleG (late stage investments) / Google Ventures (early stage investments) / Gradient Ventures.

Search: LLMs are a Real Risk, But the Analysis is Conservative\n\nâœ… Agree: LLMs like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Grok threaten traditional Google Search by offering direct answers instead of links.\nâŒ Pushback: The 5% annual growth assumption for Search may be too low.\n	â€¢	Even if Google loses market share, the overall ad market is expanding (e.g., retail media, AI-enhanced search ads).\n	â€¢	Google still dominates commercial searches in travel, auto, shopping, and health, where transactional intent is high.\n	â€¢	Search is still high-margin (40%), and a 10x PE multiple is likely too lowâ€”a more reasonable 12-15x PE could be justified.\n\nðŸ”¹ Revised Valuation Range: Instead of $885B, a more realistic range could be $1.0T to $1.3T.\n\n2. YouTube: Strong Growth, But Valuation Might Be Too Aggressive\n\nâœ… Agree: YouTube is a powerhouse, with strong ad revenue growth and subscriptions (YouTube Premium, YouTube TV) contributing more to margins.\nâŒ Pushback: Comparing YouTubeâ€™s PE multiple directly to Netflix (40x) is aggressive.\n	â€¢	Netflix is subscription-based, while YouTube is ad-heavy, and ad businesses are historically valued lower than pure subscription plays.\n	â€¢	25% margin assumption is reasonable, but a 30x PE is more appropriate than 40x.\n\nðŸ”¹ Revised Valuation Range: Instead of $634B, a more conservative estimate is $450B to $550B.\n\n3. Google Cloud: This Is the Most Undervalued Segment\n\nâœ… Agree: Google Cloud is improving rapidlyâ€”its market share is growing, and margins are catching up to AWS.\nâŒ Pushback: 40x PE on cloud profits is aggressive.\n	â€¢	AWS is the industry leader, and itâ€™s valued at ~25-30x earnings at best.\n	â€¢	A 25% revenue CAGR for five years is possible, but this valuation assumes a perfect execution scenario.\n\nðŸ”¹ Revised Valuation Range: Instead of $1.9T, a more reasonable estimate is $1.2T to $1.5T.\n\n4. Subscriptions & Devices: Growing, But Not a Major Driver\n\nâœ… Agree: Googleâ€™s hardware (Pixel, Fitbit, Nest) and subscriptions (YouTube Premium, Google One) are growing.\nâŒ Pushback: This business lacks pricing power, and margins might be lower than assumed (20% instead of 25%).\n\nðŸ”¹ Revised Valuation Range: Instead of $403B, more realistic range is $250B to $350B.\n\n5. Waymo: Pure Speculation\n\nâœ… Agree: Waymo has potential, but self-driving is years away from serious monetization.\nâŒ Pushback: The $45B valuation is outdated, and thereâ€™s no clear path to profitability.\n	â€¢	Realistically, Waymoâ€™s fair value today is closer to $15B-$30B.\n\nðŸ”¹ Revised Valuation Range: $15B to $30B instead of $45B.\n\n6. Total Valuation Adjusted for More Realistic Assumptions\n\nIf we adjust the PE multiples and assumptions based on a more conservative outlook:\n\nSegment	SOAP Valuation ($B)	Adjusted Range ($B)\nSearch	885	1,000 - 1,300\nYouTube	634	450 - 550\nCloud	1,900	1,200 - 1,500\nSubscriptions	403	250 - 350\nWaymo	45	15 - 30\nTotal Pre-Tax	3,867	2,915 - 3,730\nAfter 20% Tax	3,094	2,332 - 2,984\n\nSo instead of $3.1T, I think Google is more realistically valued at $2.3T to $2.98T.\n\n7. Is Google Undervalued?\n\nAt todayâ€™s market cap (~$1.8T):\n	â€¢	If you use the lower estimate ($2.3T) â†’ Google is ~28% undervalued.\n	â€¢	If you use the higher estimate ($2.98T) â†’ Google is ~65% undervalued.\n\nðŸš€ If you believe Google will maintain dominance in AI, Search, and Cloud, itâ€™s undervalued.\nâš ï¸ If you think Search is collapsing faster than expected, itâ€™s closer to fair value.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nâœ… I mostly agree with this thesis, but some valuations are too aggressive (Cloud, YouTube, Search multiples).\nâœ… Google is undervalued, but likely by 20-40%, not massively like 70-100%.\nâœ… Google Cloud is the hidden growth engine, and if AI adoption accelerates, this stock could break $2.5T+.'),(1685,'ValueInvesting','1j0td4b','mfekryz','2025-03-01',2,-0.3321,'As long as there are so many posts about Alphabet Iâ€™ll wait.

Nevertheless, google search corresponds to 56% of google\'s revenue (Lets assume 50% for simplicity).

I personally use Pixel, and it is very easy to access Gemini and it is a pretty solid LLM.  HOWEVER, I do use gpt as well.  In my view, google presents a massive opportunity right now because all the other Mag 7 are \"buffed up\" in valuation.  There\'s fear that they\'ll lose their dominance, but that\'s not going to kill or dent their exponential growth in AI. \n\nWhen you think of AI, I would urge you to consider thinking in terms of ecosystem. Yes chatpgt is a phenomenal app, very sticky too. But the companies that have end to end deeply entrenched ecosystems will win. In Google\'s case, they have android and they have the opportunity to embed AI at the operating system level, phone, email, text, search, video, etc etc etc. \n\nOpen AI of course has strong backing from Microsoft and the partnership with Oracle and softbank will help them accelerate.

In Q4 it was 13% YoY, and between 12-14% for each quarter of 2024. And they are investing heavily into improving it with AI overviews.

With the bigger competitors being Amazon (and I think Meta) and other areas. \n\nIf someone goes on a web browser, and Searches on an Amazon search bar, and clicks on a link, that Ad $ goes to Amazon instead of Google. That is competition. If they are on their phone and open the amazon app and search for a product there instead of a Google search, that is competition. And this extends to Facebook Marketplace, or Walmart or anything else. \n\nSo google has always had strong competition in Search. And despite this, their Search revenue continues to grow. Their revenue growth in 2024 for each quarter has been in the 12-14% range. This is despite the, honestly amazing hear in LLM improvements that have happened with Thinking models from OpenAI. \n\nSince LLMs like ChatGPT have come out back in 2022, Google Search has continued to earn and grow revenue in double digits. Advertisers are still using Google. And people are still using Google. \n\nBut that\'s right now. What about future? \n\nWell. Google has recently started rolling out, what I personally have been thinking/saying what they have needed to do for a long time. And that is integrate their Gemini 2.0 into Google Search. So users will (and already are) ask Google Search more and more complex queries. There is a new AI mode added to Google Search (rolling out). So users can ask a question on Search, and use the AI mode to dig deeper with Gemini. This is the new future of Google Search. It is no longer just blue link economy. \n\nYouTube is growing in double digits as well, so not much to say there. They have more users than Netflix. \n\nThen there is Google Cloud. Google Cloud in the last 2 quarters has grown 35% and 30% respectively. And they are limited in revenue by supply. Their Demand > Supply for Google Cloud. And even before that, their revenue was growing +20% per year. Their Gross Margin has been improving and in latest quarter is 17.5%. AWS in comparison has +35% in margin. So Google can very well achieve that looking long-term. \n\nAnd a fun fact. Google Cloud has a higher annual revenue, than YouTube! It\'s crazy to me! \n\nFor their Gemini AI, it may not be the *best* model compared to the best OpenAI has to offer. But for developers using their API it is, *by far* the most affordable and cheapest. It is very much the best value for money option for developers to use. Developers are using the Gemini 2.0 Flash API to build their own apps with AI. And Gemini 2.0 is a popular option. \n\nAlso, google has focused their AI for Multimodality. So that\'s it\'s not just a text based AI model. It can take it sound, images, video, live feed. And they are soon releasing this in Project Astra. They are leaders in multimodality. \n\nYes, they still have very strong competition from OpenAI, and Anthropic, and xAI, and Microsoft. But google is no where far behind at all. \n\nOh, and google has the entire AI stack in their hands. They have their TPU hardware which Gemini 100% runs on, so they are not depending on the Nvidia tax. They own the software and have decades of experience in AI. They have all of it. \n\nAnd they are integrating it anywhere they can. They\'re giving away Gemini Code Assist for free to compete with Claude 3.7. It\'s not as Good as Claude 3.7, but nothing beats free. \n\nThey also released the AI Co-Scientist which uses multiple AI agents together to support scientists in their work. \n\nThere\'s other stuff I don\'t recall off top of my head now. \n\nI know they are performing very strong in Waymo. They are ahead of all competition, especially Tesla. But I\'m unsure how far ahead they are against Chinese companies. \n\nPersonally, it\'s hard for me to figure where they go or how far they go with Waymo. I mean, it\'s very capex intensive imo.

That\'s adsense, and represents 10% of revenue.  Also, \"Youtube revenue\" also worth 10%. These are all \"adwords,\" the actual product. \n\n# \"Google Other\" & \"Google Cloud\"Â are the non-advertising revenue... representing 22.5% of Alphabet revenue. That includes pixel phones, software sales, cloud services, etc. \n\nI would also suggest (speculative, but IMO safe)that (a) non advertising revenue generates lowers profit and still relies on the ad business to make sense. User data\'s highest value use tends to be ad targeting.  \n\nThere is more to this than \"active user engagement.\" Reddit has a lot of active users. So does Bing. Neither generate anywhere near Google (or FB) levels of revenue from these engaged users. \n\nThat\'s because users are not \"customers,\" not consumers. Advertisers are the customers. \n\nSo... advertising. Adsense and (to a large extent) Youtube revenue piggy-backs on search. Search is the quality product... and Adsense is sub-premium extra that advertisers toggle in if/when they have maxed out their search spend... or by accident. These only sells because it\'s part of adwords\n\nUsers that search for \"*online casino*\" or \"*divorce lawyer near me*\" are worth >$10 per click.  Users that search for \"online shoe store\" are worth <$1 per click. Most searches like \"how to cook eggs\" aren\'t worth anything. Searches in some markets (eg Manhattan) are worth way more than searches in other markets... Eg Manila. Way, way more. 10X. 100X. 1000X. These are not differences that average out. \n\nThe LLM threat to google adwords is three-fold. (1) How much market share will google have? (2) How valuable is LLM advertising (a product that doesn\'t exist yet) compared to search? and (3) What parts of google search usage is affected *early* by LLM encroachment. \n\nFor #1 & #2, I think the only way to go is down. They are already so dominant, that there are no gains to be made. Only losses. #3  is where the hope is. It is very possible that \"premium searches\" will continue in the LLM age.

But their competition is not Being search. It is anywhere that has a search bar where people go to search for something (like you said, shopping) and click on a link that drives revenue for Google. \n\nImplication? Amazon is the competitor against google. Why? Because if a person wants to find a product to buy, and goes to the Amazon app instead of opening their browser for Google search, google loses that revenue and Amazon gains. Why? Because amazon has sponsored Links in their searches. And when you click on them, amazon gains as revenue which grew 18% in their recent quarter. \n\nLooking at it this way though, google has had a lot of competition for *years*. People are looking for products on their apps more than ever. Using Amazon, or Facebook marketplace, or Instagram, or TikTok, and so on. And now it is chatgpt. I haven\'t used chatgpt in a bit, but what I\'ve seen online, is it doesn\'t provide links to stuff in their results? So people don\'t really click on anything. I suspect if/when this changes and there are sponsored Links, then it will be another source of competition that is taking Google\'s ad revenue. \n\nI\'ve noticed that google Gemini, depending on what you\'re asking it, does provide links to stuff you are asking about. So maybe that will help give it some revenue. Not sure though. \n\nImo, google needs to do better with their shopping search experience. I get results for stuff that are crap. But that\'s anecdotal. \n\nEither way. If LLMs want to make revenue. They\'ll have to add in sponsored ads somehow at some point. That means adding in links or something for related products. \n\nI do wonder why not have a \"Shopping LLM\" from chatgpt or Google. It will help you look for products to click on... Searching for a new grill? The LLM will ask if you want charcoal or gas, and explain the differences and work involved with both and so on.'),(2557,'stocks','1k84w88','mp8dgzb','2025-04-26',1,0.7331,'Iâ€™m not even holding positions in GOOG and know itâ€™s the goat.

I work with Google-related products (like Google Ads and Google Workspace) every day and think about this a lot, I see it a bit differently.\n\nYou\'re right that Google has shifted heavily toward commercial intent because that is where the money is. But the bigger shift is cultural. For the past two decades, Google was the starting point of the internet. \"Just Google it\" became second nature. That cultural dominance is what kept them at the center of everything.\n\nI think that era is ending. People, especially younger users, do not want to scroll through 10 blue links anymore. They expect answers immediately, either directly inside the search results (through AI Overviews and snippets) or by skipping Google entirely and going straight to Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, or ChatGPT.\n\nIt was never just about shopping or knowledge. Google\'s real strength was being the place where every online journey started. If that habit changes, even slowly, their dominance is at risk. Not because they are bad at commercial searches, but because people may stop thinking of Google as their first stop.\n\n(And ironically, by stuffing search results with more ads, Google might actually be speeding up that shift.)  \n  \nBigger picture, the way people use the internet and how online traffic moves is going to change drastically in the next decade. Affiliate sites, SEO-driven businesses, and entire ecosystems that rely on traditional search are already getting hit. The internet we know today is going to look completely different, and Google will have to adapt fast to stay at the center of it.  \n  \nThat said, I still think Google is a very strong company with huge potential to diversify further. Their days are definitely not over. But if AI-driven answers become the new standard, it will be much harder to monetize them the same way they monetize traditional search ads. That could force Google to rethink a big part of its business model over time.\n\nThe real risk for Google and the wider internet is not competition, it is the collapse of old traffic patterns.'),(2561,'stocks','1k84w88','mp4f8as','2025-04-26',1,-0.6327,'I would never trust Google for honest reviews.

I also think this is a significant reason why Alphabet has been so undervalued. Literally holding a share of GOOG/GOOGL gives the investor a piece of GV. Their Life Sciences investment portfolio alone is understated and probably deeply undervalued.
