From a high tech consumer and a friki before wallstreetbeter.. \n-Portless phone is not happening in the near future bc no one wants that and bc companies said so, type C is here to stay for a long time, now more than ever that Apple is trying to promt IPhones closer to a high end camera for profesionals rather than a simple phone. And the port is not just for charging, its also for data transfer, easy travel (anyone has a cable anywhere in the world but not a wirless charger) and accesories like gimbals, mics and etc.\nSecond of all, Apple is always late to the party but the one everyone loves when it gets there and all the girls get pretty for him. Meaning that apple is not keeping Siri stupid bc they dont know better, rather bc they know better and want it perfect when they drop it so they can claim smarter, faster, more pretty etc. Also in some random ocasions Apple does listen to the public and i belive this is the case with AI and their assistance, sure they have problems with EU regulations and they are now using Chatgpt and siri is dumb AF.. BUT, if next year or 2027 they come out with IOS20ai or some shit like that and they rename Siri to Iris (something highly awaited and rumored in old twitter leaks) it will for sure be the best AI asistant there is. Never undererstimate the way Apple works, in a way still is Steve Jobs way. You dont have to be the best you gotta be the first or the other way around, there is no inbetween. \nAnd on a side note im also afraid they might charge for a suscription with this Iris Ai, something stupid like icloud 0.99 or 2.99 but it will be so integrated and so easy and useful that once you try it you wont go back.\nAs for slimer models and restailing.. sometimes they miss but since iphone 6 fiasco (the bending in your jeans one) im pretty sure it wont happen again.

The legal arguments against their validity, rooted in statutory interpretation, constitutional principles, and a careful distinction of precedent, appear robust and consistent across different judicial benches. Even if the administration appeals to the Supreme Court, the foundational legal weaknesses of using IEEPA for these broad tariffs are likely to persist.\n\nThis ongoing legal battle carries significant implications for the balance of power within the U.S. government and for future trade policy. Should these IEEPA tariffs be permanently blocked, it would represent a substantial check on presidential unilateralism in economic matters. While the Trump administration has indicated its willingness to pursue tariffs through other statutory authorities (such as Sections 232, 301, 122, or 338), these alternatives generally entail more stringent procedural requirements, narrower scopes, or explicit limitations on duration and rates. This suggests that any future tariff actions, while still possible, would likely be more constrained and less immediate, forcing the executive branch to operate within more traditional legislative frameworks and potentially diminishing the \"element of surprise\" that has characterized some of the administration\'s past trade actions.

Most of Appleâ€™s success was and is due to the iPhone. Period. They massively changed the world as we know, but theyâ€™re also now mature products.

Improvements over time will be marginal and superficial at best yearly and people need to accept that. There are only so many ways they can make improvements internally and externally that actually wow you.

This creates subscription stable revenue sources and makes their ecosystem continually more and more attractive for ease of use with so many different things while making it hard for those trapped in it to leave. Innovation isnâ€™t their goal. Quality and a user friendly attractive ecosystem is. Apple may surprise us. But their goal is slow but steady expansion of their ecosystem into various areas like health with Apple Watch, entertainment with subscriptions in gaming and tv and music, their devices are very arts focused for careers as we know, and they keep eyeing new opportunities.

Seems improbable but Google is intent on scaling India. Apples moat is their text message being blue, which sounds trivial but is vital to their philosophy. Amazon is in a weird place, Google cloud and azure are better packaged into Microsoftâ€™s and Alphabets ecosystem : conversely AWS is bigger than the two combined and Amazon is phenomenal at understanding themselves. Meta is the true is the weak link imo , they are desperate to throw cash at talent but they lack culture , they have zero diversification of revenue streams and Tik tok shop will rapidly improve. They arenâ€™t a cloud provider, Instagram is more touchable than a YouTube or an office 365.  US Gov wonâ€™t let them swallow a social media startup and no startup that is smart enough to challenge instagrams dominance would sell to them imo ( could be wrong tho) .  Google gets criticized for ad reliance when other segments of their business are growing faster while meta gets praised for smacking ig reels into a hollagram. â€œHey Gemini order me a Waymo from my cloud credits , preload that video of zuck vs congress on YouTube when I enter , on the way toggle Robinhood since theyare on  Google cloud on my glasses and trigger a  long shorts on Meta once the video ends.'),(4049,'stocks','1o7177q','njlcvhz','2025-10-15',4,0.7888,'There service business is incredible and so profitable thats why they have continued to go up even with peak iphone sales.Â '),(4050,'stocks','1o7177q','njkq83e','2025-10-15',8,-0.2579,'Itâ€™s one of the the least susceptible to the inevitable AI crash.
