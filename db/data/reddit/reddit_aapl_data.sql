From a high tech consumer and a friki before wallstreetbeter.. \n-Portless phone is not happening in the near future bc no one wants that and bc companies said so, type C is here to stay for a long time, now more than ever that Apple is trying to promt IPhones closer to a high end camera for profesionals rather than a simple phone. And the port is not just for charging, its also for data transfer, easy travel (anyone has a cable anywhere in the world but not a wirless charger) and accesories like gimbals, mics and etc.\nSecond of all, Apple is always late to the party but the one everyone loves when it gets there and all the girls get pretty for him. Meaning that apple is not keeping Siri stupid bc they dont know better, rather bc they know better and want it perfect when they drop it so they can claim smarter, faster, more pretty etc. Also in some random ocasions Apple does listen to the public and i belive this is the case with AI and their assistance, sure they have problems with EU regulations and they are now using Chatgpt and siri is dumb AF.. BUT, if next year or 2027 they come out with IOS20ai or some shit like that and they rename Siri to Iris (something highly awaited and rumored in old twitter leaks) it will for sure be the best AI asistant there is. Never undererstimate the way Apple works, in a way still is Steve Jobs way. You dont have to be the best you gotta be the first or the other way around, there is no inbetween. \nAnd on a side note im also afraid they might charge for a suscription with this Iris Ai, something stupid like icloud 0.99 or 2.99 but it will be so integrated and so easy and useful that once you try it you wont go back.\nAs for slimer models and restailing.. sometimes they miss but since iphone 6 fiasco (the bending in your jeans one) im pretty sure it wont happen again.

The legal arguments against their validity, rooted in statutory interpretation, constitutional principles, and a careful distinction of precedent, appear robust and consistent across different judicial benches. Even if the administration appeals to the Supreme Court, the foundational legal weaknesses of using IEEPA for these broad tariffs are likely to persist.\n\nThis ongoing legal battle carries significant implications for the balance of power within the U.S. government and for future trade policy. Should these IEEPA tariffs be permanently blocked, it would represent a substantial check on presidential unilateralism in economic matters. While the Trump administration has indicated its willingness to pursue tariffs through other statutory authorities (such as Sections 232, 301, 122, or 338), these alternatives generally entail more stringent procedural requirements, narrower scopes, or explicit limitations on duration and rates. This suggests that any future tariff actions, while still possible, would likely be more constrained and less immediate, forcing the executive branch to operate within more traditional legislative frameworks and potentially diminishing the \"element of surprise\" that has characterized some of the administration\'s past trade actions.
