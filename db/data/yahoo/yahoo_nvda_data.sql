Time is your friend. I\'m 70 years old and opened my first brokerage account in 1975 with USAA when I was 21 years old. Most of what I bought up until the late 80\'s were mutual funds. At the advent of the internet boom in the 90\'s I began to trade individual stocks and used Scottrade. During the next 10 years my trading was hit or miss. When my parents passed a few years apart in early 2000 - 2004 I inherited 250k and began investing in stocks for the long term looking forward to retirement in my 60\'s. I bought GOOG shortly after the IPO in 2004 at $90 a share, still have those shares with an initial investment of $5,000 for 59 shares bought in the 2004 IPO has now turned $321,503. My best investment even after dropping since this August has been AAPL purchased roughly 10 k in December 2004 now worth more than 5 million. Others I\'ve bought and held for 20 years are MSFT, CSCO, AVGO, NFLX, and others. If I had sold these the way most of you trade in and out on every dip I would never had a chance at enjoying the wealth I have today. This post is long but th epoint is if you want the bulk of profit available to you then you need to forget where NVDA will be Monday, next month or next year and be willing to hold it a minimum of 5 years. I said minimum and it would be better if you would to hold 10 - 20 years. You\'ll make more likethat than any job will ever provide.

First to market technological advantage of at least two years and perhaps 5 years or more over its competitors who are just now ramping up R&D to try and compete. Meanwhile NVIDIA is the only choice for the ubiquitous global adoption of AI by enterprises across all industries while offering turn key data center and platform options to clients via its proprietary purpose built AI platforms. I don\'t see any \"real\" competition from other chip makers for two years. NVIDIA is the gold standard. I think the biggest threat to NVIDIA is a macro economic black swan event that might temporarily diminish current projections of enterprise investments in NVIDIA chips and data solutions.

Consider the market growth potential NVDA operates in, ask if NVDA has an advantage over other suppliers, and lastly has NVDA exceeded earnings estimates.  Then make an analytical decision if you want to buy or sell this stock, keeping in mind short-term fluctuations occur, but fundamentals will dictate long-term stock prices.  Ignore current PE ratio, because that is based on trailing 12 months and you want to look at future earnings.

Iam not going to sell my 60K of NVDA stocks. It is tough to hold it when it gyrate like this. But I think within 4 months- By March 2025, this will be at $260. Clearly NVDA need to enter into contract with a second source.  TSMC is doing their best. But they have other customers as well.  Either Samsung or Intel would be another source.  When that agreement is penned and announced, this stock will bounce $60 points in single day.','2024-11-27',0.9555,4),(356,'Andrew','Bullish: No Iâ€™m not selling Nvidia to chase shorts on other stocks.
