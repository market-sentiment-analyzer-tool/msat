It\'s the fact that there back orders go all the way to mid to late 2025 according to Dan Ives of Wedbush.  This info will definitely have an effect on investors decision on Nvidia\'s stock price going forward.  That on top of the Blackwell series coming to market.','2024-04-26',0.3804,50),(7,'Brad111','The new Blackwell chip will be completely ground breaking, which is why every single chip is already booked and sold. For the customers buying it, the TCO (total Cost of Ownership) will be 25x less then H100. Just imagine what the 3rd generation \'Ruben\' chip will look like when it comes out next year. There is no doubt in my mind that NVIDIA will be the first 4 Trillion dollar company and then the first 5 Trillion dollar company.','2024-06-15',0.5588,147),(8,'Michael','Just buy it and hold it and don\'t fret th eshort term volitility. Time is your friend. I\'m 70 years old and opened my first brokerage account in 1975 with USAA when I was 21 years old. Most of what I bought up until the late 80\'s were mutual funds. At the advent of the internet boom in the 90\'s I began to trade individual stocks and used Scottrade. During the next 10 years my trading was hit or miss. When my parents passed a few years apart in early 2000 - 2004 I inherited 250k and began investing in stocks for the long term looking forward to retirement in my 60\'s. I bought GOOG shortly after the IPO in 2004 at $90 a share, still have those shares with an initial investment of $5,000 for 59 shares bought in the 2004 IPO has now turned $321,503. My best investment even after dropping since this August has been AAPL purchased roughly 10 k in December 2004 now worth more than 5 million. Others I\'ve bought and held for 20 years are MSFT, CSCO, AVGO, NFLX, and others. If I had sold these the way most of you trade in and out on every dip I would never had a chance at enjoying the wealth I have today. This post is long but th epoint is if you want the bulk of profit available to you then you need to forget where NVDA will be Monday, next month or next year and be willing to hold it a minimum of 5 years. I said minimum and it would be better if you would to hold 10 - 20 years. You\'ll make more likethat than any job will ever provide. Just buy NVDA and hold it 20 years.','2023-11-11',0.9832,671),(9,'Jeff','for new retail buyers: the daily ups and downs are common. don\'t lose site of long term wealth by selling in panic.

First to market technological advantage of at least two years and perhaps 5 years or more over its competitors who are just now ramping up R&D to try and compete. Meanwhile NVIDIA is the only choice for the ubiquitous global adoption of AI by enterprises across all industries while offering turn key data center and platform options to clients via its proprietary purpose built AI platforms. I don\'t see any \"real\" competition from other chip makers for two years. NVIDIA is the gold standard. I think the biggest threat to NVIDIA is a macro economic black swan event that might temporarily diminish current projections of enterprise investments in NVIDIA chips and data solutions. The risk reward proposition looks very strong for the next two years and NVIDIA continues to \"beat\" on revenue and earnings while expanding the breadth and depth of its offerings.','2024-06-03',0.9887,19),(12,'Robo23','Instead of reacting to comments here, click on the \'Analysis\' section above.  See the estimated earnings per share for this fiscal year (2024), see the estimated earnings per share for next fiscal year (2025), calculate forward-looking PE values for each, also calculate the expected increase in earnings per share year-over year.  Consider the market growth potential NVDA operates in, ask if NVDA has an advantage over other suppliers, and lastly has NVDA exceeded earnings estimates.  Then make an analytical decision if you want to buy or sell this stock, keeping in mind short-term fluctuations occur, but fundamentals will dictate long-term stock prices.  Ignore current PE ratio, because that is based on trailing 12 months and you want to look at future earnings. For me, NVDA is an overwhelming buy, but do your own calculations and analysis, and come to your own conclusions.','2023-08-27',0.9758,140),(13,'Martin','UBS\' Timothy Acuri, just raised his price target of Nvidia from $120-$150. He projects next year\'s revenue to be $200B and EPS to be $5 due to strong sales of Blackwell chips. There is massive spending globally in building data infrastructure - $92B this year alone. Hold on to your semiconductor stocks for the next 2-3 years. This is going to $4 trillion.','2024-07-08',0.7184,26),(14,'Benjamin','Nvidia will continue to dominate the AI GPU market for many quarters to come, and perhaps years.  They have big head start, the best GPUâ€™s, R&D and CUDA.','2024-07-06',0.5719,14),(15,'Dave','The thing I really like about NVDA is the fact they have such amazing  foresight. This is very apparent. The development of their AI chips, which they started working on years ago. The fact that these chips are tied with their own unique software platform is another example. Thir foreseeing capacity issues over a year ago and taking steps to alleviate this problem shows more foresight.... the plants under construction in Arizona, Japan, and Vietnam. So investors can restt assured that NVDA has their eye on the ball, and are looking years down the road. They really have a great vision and are doing a remarkable job of executing it.','2024-03-25',0.9426,34),(16,'JeffG','Investors focused on backward-looking metrics likely missed out on Nvidia (NVDA), one of the most lucrative investment opportunities in the past decade.','2024-05-24',0.5046,20),(17,'Dave','Tomorrow should be a great day for Micron and Nvidia regardless of any economic news that\'s released. Micron\'s earnings report proved that AI isn\'t losing ground, and spending will continue on semiconductors by the biggest players no matter what happens with the economy in the coming months (even though I still think a soft landing is what\'s actually going to happen). We are in the money and the stock price will reflect that very soon.','2024-09-25',0.8693,13),(18,'Bob C.','NVDA did well after last split. I\'m looking for a 20% move in the next 3 Weeks target $145. NVDA moved 27% from Split Announcement to Split. The move was like the last split. I think it moved up almost 20% post split last time. Good luck.','2024-06-09',0.9081,20),(19,'Brad111','I\'ve bought NVIDIA dips for the last 6 years and will continue to do so should any present themselves. Earnings are May 22 and I\'m expecting them to be blowout in the $26+ Billion dollar range.

To be as large as they are, growing at the rate that they are.... it\'s unfathomable.

In fact, the company will deliver over 1 million of its new H20 chips, which are priced between $12,000 and $13,000 each and have been designed to bypass U.S. restrictions on selling AI processors to China. According to SemiAnalysis, this number is nearly double what Huawei is expected to sell of its rival chip, the Ascend 910Bâ€¦..','2024-07-04',-0.7734,21),(24,'Stevo','Always try to have some dry powder for these types of setups!   This stock is monumental..','2024-06-25',0,31),(25,'Sonny','whole lot of speculation going on here. just buy NVDA and hold it for a couple of years and you will do fine. I bought last week and so far I\'m up about 6 grand. There was also a lot of talk about whether you should buy before the split or after the split. Take a chance on NVDA and just hold it for awhile.','2024-06-08',0.9543,14),(26,'Doctors','The bottom line is that NVIDIA delivered strong performance and will continue to do so. Many bankers seem unable to grasp the full potential of the future and err on the side of caution out of fear of being wrong about this stock. I sensed the frustration in Jensen\'s voice on tonight\'s call when he was asked such basic questions, like whether AI/Blackwell will generate ROI for their customers. It was clear he was flabbergasted by the lack of understanding, even from the so-called \'big players.\' Unfortunately, poor decisions by these bankers sometimes lead to unnecessary price drops.','2024-08-28',-0.8316,14),(27,'fred','its been a long time since we came across anything this exciting in the market.  amazon back to prior to covid,  maybe microsoft during the many splits, apple after introducing iphone,  but this is up there as one of those once in a lifetime sort of stocks.','2024-02-05',0.7525,14),(28,'Blue Shark','What is astounding is the enormous potential in all walks of life. Now, commercial data center is leading the way and nowhere near completion, sovereign still hasnâ€™t even started to hatch, automotive has begun and will thrust brutally, pharma only starting, robotics, military, health and general appliances are almost untouched so far. Years and years of growth are in the cards.','2024-06-26',0.296,16),(29,'Rick','60% of profits are coming from its core dominant chips but the rest of 40% Is the increasing  partnerships with vertical industries.','2024-06-18',0.2382,16),(30,'Giuseppe','Largest historical split ratio for Nvidia was 4:1 in 2021 and the pre-split price on July 19, 2021 was $744. Post-split price = $186. So, if there is a split this year, we should expect a post-split price between $150 & $200. Depending on the trajectory of the share price over the next few weeks, we should expect a split ratio between 5:1 and 7:1. This would require shareholder approval for more authorized shares. We shall see.','2024-04-26',0.8905,14),(31,'AIRoboInvestor17','Total addressable market is $1T for AI. Nvidia\'s new chip is 20-30 times more efficient and powerful than older chips, and will be available this year. Nvidia\' tweaked their design and networking options in many ways to supported large language models like GPT-5 or other beasts that are coming up soon. Nvidia is trying to broaden the market beyond the data center by making their technology more accessible to end-users, like robotics companies, or healthcare providers. They are making steps towards creating their own cloud offering to end-users. They are much more than a hardware provider, but in addition to software, they will also provide the full stack.','2024-03-19',0.8307,13),(32,'Lou','Amazing times weâ€™re living in.

Their response was the following.  Okay.  All right.  We\'re building a very, very large data center, very big.  About half of a huge data center, were building for them, lots of Nvidia chips, the new chips, the new Nvidia interconnect, liquid cool and they\'re primarily for training, I mean, not inferencing.  It\'s -- were doing masses and masses of training.','2024-06-11',0.9001,18),(34,'Harneet','The bearish comments are the same mindset that believed the internet was a fadâ€¦ you have no idea the impact, scalability and cost-benefit analysis that AI brings to industriesâ€¦ attempting to identify trends or look at fundamentals outside the actual technology are laughable.

Itâ€™s wonderful to see new members in the investment community, good luck.','2024-05-08',0.8625,5),(40,'Kenneth','Key Banc with an analyst in the top 2% offers a new price target this morning at 180.00 on Nvidia as revenues of Blackwell start to roll in.  They also state in the note that Nvidia will beat on the quarter on earnings and revenues.','2024-10-10',0.6597,15),(41,'WilliamJ','The split is psychological, but the new lower price brings in more retail investors and eventually the earnings growing over 50% a year backs up the explosive share price increase post split so things even out eventually.','2024-05-24',0.9253,15),(42,'michael','CEO Jensen Huang believes Blackwell will be the company\'s \"most successful product\" in its history. If he\'s right, the current pullback presents a great buying opportunity.','2024-09-09',0.8999,22),(43,'LarryB','I bought in during 2017 at 42 per. Nvidia\'s stock price, which has gained nearly 800% since the start of 2023, resulted in its high-profile 10-for-1 stock split last June. So bears -- try and scare me. I\'ve made so much money it\'s hard to think of what to buy next.','2024-08-24',0.3612,12),(44,'Brad111','I was just thinking about the many investors that bought NVIDIA \"really back in the day\" and that NVIDIA really is a \'generational stock\'. I\'ve read often that NVIDIA investments will pay for their kids or grandkids college\'s, home mortgages, future retirements, cars, etc. and it just makes me happy that astute investors aren\'t looking at \'next Fridays\' stock price, but instead looking at 2025, 2027 and 2035 (and beyond). (and praise ANYONE in their 20\'s that are buying NVIDIA! GENIUS!) You younger crew...just make sure that you are maxing out your 401k\'s and ROTH\'s! Even if you don\'t own a single share of NVIDIA, still make SURE you are maxing out your retirement accounts. Compounding is an amazing thing!!!','2024-02-04',0.9748,21),(45,'BGPlace','Better cpi than expected - rate cuts baked in - rotation out to cyclical.

Hope we agree on that? Once the quarterly results are out Nvidiaâ€™s price appreciation will accelerate significantly and there is no stopping it. So therefore and hence this is the best time to cover your short positions and or buy more. Mark my words as to what I just said.','2024-07-27',0.9541,14),(50,'UltraRA','With recent partnerships, a pullback is healthy and normal.
