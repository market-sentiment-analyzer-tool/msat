I purchased the 15\" MacBook Air with 8 GB of RAM, 256 GB of storage, and the M2 chip for $999. It has surpassed all my expectations, proving to be the finest laptop I\'ve ever owned. The battery life is incredible, the screen displays crystal-clear visuals, no noisy fans, and the overall quality is top-notch. In comparison, the $1600 HP touch screen work laptop provided during the pandemic doesn\'t come close in performance and the value for the money. Previously, I didn\'t grasp the appeal of Apple laptops as I have been a Windows guy for decades, but now I get why they\'re favored by many.','2024-06-02',0.6867,40),(3,'Jasmine','Bullish: Apple has a lot of capital, several top-of-class products, and more insulation than most against the pro-consumer-enforcement measures governments are beginning to enact.

Since then I\'ve received over $39k in re-invested dividends and am up almost 900%.  This isn\'t a trade, it\'s a buy and hold for future generational wealth with probably 2-3 stock splits between now and when I retire.

AAPL further diversified it\'s revenues across products and services becoming increasingly less dependent on any one product as their recurring revenue from services continues to grow as well as becoming much less dependent on China for the origin of those revenues.

So far not one bad review.  And as far as price--- of course people will buy it. The same people who purchase a infotainment system in their car for $3000, and the same people who go to a fur store and buy a $3000-4000 piece of furniture, and the same people who spend $4000-5000 on a vacation that last one week.  This is going to make Apple a ton of money--600 apps now and thousands to come as every app developer realizes that this is the next major item for both business and pleasure.','2024-02-05',0.9663,10),(18,'Steven','I\'ve held Apple since 2007.  The cycle of downgrade-induced price drops followed about six to twelve months later by all-time-highs seems to be repeating itself once again.  Apple a long-term hold.  Why?

As usual, Apple stock domenstrate that it is the best of all in the stock market. Looking forward, I believe Apple stock will break new highs until the earnings date at which its forward new highs will depend  on the guidance of the following quarters. However, my strong personal feelings tell me that Apple stock will continue doing great because of the so many good news releases to AI applications that will termoundasly provide to the top line and bottom line of the company. Thus, I predict Apple stock will easily hit $300 by December 31/24. That is a result of favourable macroeconomics conditions that will fuel bullish markets.','2024-07-06',0.9872,16),(21,'Gary','Bullish: People get excited when Apple opens big, but it generally tapers off by the end of the day.
