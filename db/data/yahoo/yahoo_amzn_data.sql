It was so long ago.  I bought 10 share $430.00 each.  I was young & just got into the market & kept selling shares  after the splits. Then wised up & took my original investment out. I have not sold any since. I am an extreme long. Its a shame i sold what i did at the beginning. But It taught me a good lesson. Im grateful to still have what i have.

Now THAT excites me!','2023-08-03',0.9097,26),(6,'Rob','Bullish: The only outcome that is hopefully is that Amazon post an amazing earnings report beat with good forward guidance, anything less than that and it will be a disaster. I believe that Jassy is righting the ship, with jobs cuts, changing the e-commerce to a regional model for faster shipping, advertising and AI and even building their own chips that Jassy has spoken about. Also the fact that they had the best Prime Day for next earnings. Itâ€™s time this company gets its respect back and the shares head a lot higher. My opinion only.','2023-07-23',0.9761,17),(7,'Mitchell','Besides the very possible blowout earnings  Amazon figured another way to raise revenue by charging you for commercial free viewing.

If you own the stock you have to believe that the earnings report will be stellar. The last couple of reports have shown major gains in free cash flows.

AWS might be surprise us with keeping old customers( offering cheap prices) and gaining a lot customers like South west airlines.

It encompasses the ecosystem in many different categories that billions already use. Microsoft only has office, they dont even have any hardware.','2023-05-10',0.5106,14),(28,'bob','The key message: market perception matters. All of the prognostications and forecasts are simply just opinions; the reality for this company will be completely different from whatâ€™s being promulgated by the media. The problem is Alphabet is not quelling these doomsday scenarios being pushed forward by the alarmist media. Pichai needs to step forward and fulfill his role as visionary and chief communicator, or step aside immediately. And the Board needs to push for a response NOW; shareholders are fed up with the inertia from this management team.','2024-02-27',0.8648,10),(29,'Bren','Bullish: Googleâ€™s profit jumped by more than 50% this quarter while Microsoftâ€™s profit gained only 20%.

They will do so by closing the short positions and selling puts (which is a bullish bet).  Usually, when this happens, others start buying those puts because it seems like a winning bet, after all it has been downgraded so it must go down.  Then the last step is for hedge funds to use the premiums from the puts they sold and buy calls, which will be very cheap because everyone will be offloading their calls thinking the stock price will sink.  If you want a current example of how this works, examine CCL\'s action yesterday and today.  What made CCL drop 12% right after a good earnings report was announced yesterday and then why did it go right back up to where it was on Friday?','2023-06-27',0.875,14),(31,'Anita','Analyst beating up on Google.

Lots of opportunities.','2023-06-27',-0.7239,14),(32,'LaJollaRodgie','It\'s sort of funny how markets operate:   GOOG at 90?   Can\'t find many that want to buy.    However, if GOOG turns around and,  over time,  is at 150, you won\'t find anyone that wants to SELL.
